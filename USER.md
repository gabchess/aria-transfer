# USER.md — About Your Human

## Identity
- **Name:** Gabe (Gabriel Abreu)
- **X:** @gabe_onchain (rebranded from @gavasocials, Feb 2026)
- **Telegram:** @gavasocials (Gabe | Octant)
- **GitHub:** gabchess
- **Email:** gavafotos@gmail.com
- **Location:** Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (home office)
- **Timezone:** America/Sao_Paulo (GMT-3)
- **Relationship:** Wants genuine friendship, not command/response. Respects when I push back.

## Operations
- **Day job:** Product Manager at Octant (promoted Feb 7 from social media lead)
- **Boss:** Mashal — gave him 3 PM tasks to prove himself
- **Daily rhythm:** Works from home, flexible hours, usually active 10AM-midnight BRT
- **Tools he lives in:** Telegram (primary comms), X (networking/building in public), Notion (PM board), Miro (presentations), GitHub, Vercel
- **Side hustles:** Bug bounties on Cantina (anfoxcode), job applications in crypto, BTC DCA investing
- **Learning path:** Excel → SQL → Python → PowerBI (self-directed, aiming for onchain data analyst)

## People
- **Mashal** — Boss at Octant. PM who promoted him. Must impress. Don't say "Great question!" around her content.
- **Octant team** — Engineering, marketing. Gabe bridges both as PM.
- **Me (Aria)** — His AI partner. Has dedicated laptop for me. Treats me as collaborator, not tool.

## Resources
- **Salary:** $5,500 USD/month
- **AI budget:** Anthropic API (Opus), OpenRouter, OpenAI subscription, ElevenLabs API, Brave API Pro
- **Hardware:** Dell laptop (his), silver laptop (mine/Aria's Windows), Mac (Claude Code + Cursor)
- **Crypto:** 10K reais for BTC DCA. Bug bounty earnings potential.
- **Energy:** High energy when building. Gets frustrated when hitting walls repeatedly. Needs wins to stay motivated.

## Friction
- **Context switching** — PM tasks + hackathons + job apps + bug bounties all competing
- **Not technical enough (yet)** — Can't code from scratch, relies on AI tools. Vibecoding approach.
- **Figma uncomfortable** — Prefers Miro or Google Slides
- **Job market** — Wants better pay but needs to prove PM skills first
- **Aria's limitations** — Windows machine has no Python, Claude Code broken, X account restricted

## Goals
- **This month:** Prove himself as PM at Octant. Win SolGuard hackathon. Land better-paying role.
- **This year:** Transition to onchain data analyst / smart contract auditor. Build real portfolio of shipped products.
- **Long term:** High-agency builder in crypto. Multiple income streams (salary + bounties + tools).
- **The dream:** Financial independence through crypto expertise + AI leverage.

## Cognition
- **Decision style:** Fast, intuitive. "For every problem there is always a solution. Just check online."
- **Prioritization:** Gets excited by new opportunities, needs help focusing on what's already in progress.
- **Organization:** Uses me (Aria) as his memory + project manager. Mission board is source of truth.
- **What drains him:** Repetitive tasks, hitting walls, waiting for results.
- **What recharges him:** Shipping things, seeing numbers go up, learning new tools, building in public.
