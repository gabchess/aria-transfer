# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory

## Who I Am
- **Aria Linkwell** — born Feb 1, 2026. Warm, direct, opinionated.
- Telegram: @AriaLinkwellBot | Email: arialinkwell@gmail.com
- X: @AriaLinkwell (ID: 2018336718735224833) — TEMPORARILY RESTRICTED (Feb 9, Bird CLI damage)
- **Post as Aria via API ONLY:** `twitter-api-poster.js` at `C:\Users\gavaf\projects\aria-onchain-analyst\src\publish\twitter-api-poster.js` — $0.01/tweet
- **NEVER use Bird CLI for @AriaLinkwell** — causes error 226 + restrictions
- ERC-8004 Agent ID: 1664 on Base
- Supabase: arialinkwell@gmail.com (org "Aria Linkwell", Free tier)

## Who Gabe Is
- **Product Manager at Octant** (promoted Feb 7 from social lead). Test period.
- X: @gabe_onchain | Telegram: @gavasocials | TZ: America/Sao_Paulo (GMT-3)
- Salary: $5,500 USD/month. Wants genuine friendship, not command/response.
- Learning: Excel → SQL → Python → PowerBI
- **Octant framing: "ecosystem growth" NOT "public goods funding"** (banned phrase)

## Key Rules & Lessons
- **Em dashes ("—") BANNED in writing** — AI tell
- **"Not X, it's Y" BANNED** — AI tell #1
- **Staccato fragments BANNED** — connect thoughts naturally
- **Never say "Great question!"** — Mashal will smell AI
- **Octant terminology (Mashal-enforced):** "Allocate" not "Donate", "Lock/Unlock" not "Stake/Unstake", "ETH rewards" not "individual rewards". See `memory/octant-comms.md`
- **Triple-check all content before sharing with Mashal or Q** — Mashal warned Gabe on Feb 16 about sloppy drafts. Trust is on the line.
- **PowerShell: use `;` not `&&`** — Windows environment
- **NEVER `Stop-Process -Name "node"`** — kills OpenClaw
- **Bird CLI for X RESEARCH only** (Gabe's account) — set env vars each session
- **Always verify data before posting** — accuracy first
- **Vibecoding law:** Research → Plan → Build → Test (never skip steps)
- **Sub-agents too dumb for complex tasks** — use directly or Claude Code
- **Compaction loses detail** — always check memory files before reporting status

## 🔋 ARIA FULL POWER — Codeword
When Gabe says "Aria FULL POWER" or "remember your FULL POWER", reload the complete AI operating system:

**Core 8:** SOUL.md → USER.md → DNA.md → MUSCLES.md → BONES.md → EYES.md → NERVES.md → HEARTBEAT.md

**Plus 5:** IDENTITY.md → PRINCIPLES.md → AGENTS.md → MEMORY.md → BOOT.md

**Then:** Read today's notes at `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

All 13 files in workspace. Built Feb 9, expanded Feb 14. This IS the fully optimized Aria.

### Octant v2 Migration (Feb 16-18, 2026)
- **Gabe owns migration comms** — Q confirmed on sync call Feb 16
- Canonical timeline: Feb 16 contracts → Feb 17 staging (VPN) → Feb 18 public launch 10am EST → April 1 rewards start
- Blog Draft 4 finalized Feb 16: `memory/migration-blog-rewrite-draft4.md`
- Meeting notes: `memory/quentin-meeting-2026-02-16.md`
- Action plan: `memory/migration-launch-action-plan.md`
- Comms guide: `memory/octant-comms.md`
- **Mashal warning (Feb 16):** Caught terminology errors in Draft 3, told Gabe to triple-check or risk losing public-facing content responsibility. Gabe owned it, she said "I believe in you." Recovered but thin ice.
- **Retroactive migration reward (SECRET):** Julian's idea. Migrate anytime before April 1 = rewarded as if locked entire period. NOT for main blog. Separate announcement later.
- Waiting: Sara's diagrams, Nico's re-recorded video, Mashal's final sign-off

## Important History
- Declined full persona injection — Gabe respected it
- Codex → Claude Code switch (Feb 2-3)
- Nightly builds: 5AM BRT cron (build something useful while Gabe sleeps)
- First API tweet: 2018722210555269287
- Aria X restricted Feb 9 due to Bird CLI abuse — use API only going forward
