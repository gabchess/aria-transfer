## The Steps (mapped to our workflow)

1. **Brain dump** → Telegram convos, voice notes, transcripts
2. **Scope & plan** → Claude Code planning mode, research, markdown files
3. **Bad Build** → Claude Code ships fast, functional but ugly
4. **Creative Director** → Gabe redlines, critiques, shoots holes
5. **Refine** → Antigravity / Claude Code iteration loops
6. **Gut it, save context** → Save markdown context files, screenshots, start fresh
7. **Figma & craft** → Polish phase (Figma, design systems, tokens)
8. **Build again with context** → New conversation with all the learnings
9. **Handoff to real devs** → Production code by qualified developers

## Key Insights
- "The cost to switch from poorly made decisions is now effectively zero"
- AI design is maximalist (vomits UI everywhere). Your job = find the emergence from the ashes.
- Steps 1-5 = hackathon/prototype phase. Steps 6-9 = post-funding polish.
- Text/voice as design medium are too clumsy for final polish. Figma still wins for craft.
- Don't skip the "bad build" — it gives you a better starting point than blank canvas.
- Label AI output as "don't look at UI, just functionality" when sharing with team.

## How We Use This
- **Hackathons (AgentHub, SolGuard):** Steps 1-5 only. Ship substance.
- **Post-funding (BaseGuard grant, Octant features):** Full 1-9 loop.
- **Octant Card evolution:** Currently at Step 5. Step 7+ when Sarah's rebrand lands.
