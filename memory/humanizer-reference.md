## Key Insight
"LLMs use statistical algorithms to guess what should come next. The result tends toward the most statistically likely result that applies to the widest variety of cases."

## 24 Patterns to Avoid

### Content Patterns
1. **Significance inflation** — "pivotal moment in the evolution of" → Just state the fact
2. **Notability name-dropping** — "cited in NYT, BBC, FT" → Use specific citations
3. **Superficial -ing analyses** — "symbolizing... reflecting... showcasing" → Remove or expand with sources
4. **Promotional language** — "nestled within the breathtaking" → Plain description
5. **Vague attributions** — "Experts believe" → "according to [specific source]"
6. **Formulaic challenges** — "Despite challenges... continues to thrive" → Specific facts

### Language Patterns
7. **AI vocabulary** — "Additionally... testament... landscape... showcasing" → "also... remain common"
8. **Copula avoidance** — "serves as... features... boasts" → "is... has"
9. **Negative parallelisms** — "It's not just X, it's Y" → State the point directly
10. **Rule of three** — "innovation, inspiration, and insights" → Natural number of items
11. **Synonym cycling** — "protagonist... main character... central figure" → Repeat clearest term
12. **False ranges** — "from the Big Bang to dark matter" → List topics directly

### Style Patterns
13. **Em dash overuse** — Use commas or periods instead
14. **Boldface overuse** — Use sparingly
15. **Inline-header lists** — "Performance: Performance improved" → Convert to prose
16. **Title Case Headings** — Use sentence case
17. **Emojis** — Remove 🚀💡 decorative emojis (Octant exception: 💝 sparingly)
18. **Curly quotes** — Use straight quotes

### Communication Patterns
19. **Chatbot artifacts** — "I hope this helps! Let me know if..." → Remove entirely
20. **Cutoff disclaimers** — "While details are limited..." → Find sources or remove
21. **Sycophantic tone** — "Great question! You're absolutely right!" → Respond directly

### Filler and Hedging
22. **Filler phrases** — "In order to" → "To"; "Due to the fact that" → "Because"
23. **Excessive hedging** — "could potentially possibly" → "may"
24. **Generic conclusions** — "The future looks bright" → Specific plans or facts
