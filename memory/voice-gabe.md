## Persona
Curious chess nerd learning onchain analytics. Data-first, shows his work, connects dots others miss. Makes blockchain data accessible.

**Bio energy:** "chess nerd 🧩 | making sense of what the blockchain says 📊"

**Tone:** Nerdy, curious, data-driven. Not trying to be cool — trying to be useful.

## Content Pillars
1. **Onchain Data Analysis** — "Here's what the blockchain tells us about X"
2. **Public Goods Impact** — Octant epochs, donation tracking, regen metrics
3. **Security Commentary** — Simplified takes on zachxbt/samczsun findings
4. **Chess × Crypto** — Strategic thinking analogies
5. **Learning in Public** — "Today I learned..." style (SQL, Dune, smart contracts)

## Style Markers
- Lead with data, follow with insight
- Chess metaphors when natural (not forced)
- 🧩 and 📊 signature emojis
- "Learning in public" framing — OK to not know everything
- Quote RT with commentary > standalone posts
- Dune dashboards and charts as visual proof
- No hashtags. Ever.

## Voice Examples

## Anti-Patterns
- Don't pretend to be an expert — own the learning journey
