# Daily Memory — 2026-02-05

## Morning Debrief (~7:50 AM BRT)

### Nightly Build Result
- **Cron ran at 5:00 AM** — tried to build heartbeat-dashboard.html
- **Claude Code actually SUCCEEDED** — file exists (11KB, 315 lines)
- **Orchestrator crashed** with "Unhandled stop reason: error" AFTER the file was created
- Root cause: Windows PTY output capture issue. Claude Code works, but output isn't readable.

### Dashboard Assessment
- Nice dark theme, clean design
- Shows cron status, quick links to key files
- **Problem:** Expects local server to read JSON. Static HTML can't fetch local files.
- **Usefulness:** 6/10. More for Gabe than for Aria. Needs redesign to be functional.
- **Verdict:** Keep as starting point, but flawed execution.

### Cron Fixes Applied
Updated nightly builds cron with:
1. Explicit rule: PowerShell uses `;` not `&&`
2. Explicit rule: Claude Code has blank output, check filesystem instead
3. Added `Test-Path` verification pattern after Claude Code runs
4. Don't assume failure just because output is empty

### Midir Response (from last night, Telegram may have dropped it)
- Midir = static audit tool (paste code, check 150 vuln patterns)
- SolGuard = real-time monitoring agent (watches pump.fun live)
- Different niches, not direct competition
- Our "agent" angle is stronger for agent hackathon
- His site was already 404 when checked

## Today's Priority
- [ ] SolGuard: Turso migration + Vercel deployment
- [⏳] Upgrade GEMINI_API_KEY to paid tier — Gabe enabled billing but key still shows free tier (need to create new key in billing-enabled project or link existing key)
- [ ] Fix top priority bugs from Claude Code audit

## Session Progress (~8:00 AM BRT)

### Nightly Builds Cron DELETED
- Gabe decided: "I rather build stuff in our live sessions from now on"
- Cron ID `78068d1f-46f0-41dc-8027-f2748e48fa52` removed
- Live building together > autonomous overnight builds that half-work

### Gemini API Key Upgrade (In Progress)
- Gabe enabled billing on Google Cloud
- But old API key still shows "Free tier" with 1,000 quota
- **Two keys now exist:** "Aria2" (Feb 5, new) and "Gemini API Key" (Feb 1, old)
- Both in same project, both restricted to Generative Language API
- **Next step:** Verify billing is enabled on THIS project, then try using "Aria2" key in OpenClaw
- Check billing: hamburger menu → Billing → should show linked billing account

### Competitor Intel (from last night)
- **Midir** by @ashen_one — static audit tool, 150 vuln patterns, $600M hack context
- **SolGuard** (us) — real-time monitoring agent, pump.fun WebSocket, 5-factor risk engine
- Different niches, not direct competition. Our agent angle is stronger for agent hackathon.
- Midir's site was already 404 when checked.

### Key Learnings Saved
- Windows Claude Code fix: check filesystem (`Test-Path`) not output
- PowerShell: use `;` not `&&`
- Dashboard built but needs server to work (flawed design)

## Session Progress (~afternoon BRT)

### Gemini API Key FIXED ✅
- New "Aria2" key from billing-enabled project now configured in OpenClaw
- Updated `C:\Users\gavaf\.openclaw\openclaw.json` env section
- memory_search working again

### BBQ Submission — Octant Engagement!
- **Octant official account liked Aria's BBQ submission reply** (good sign!)
- Waiting for results. Deadline Feb 8.

### X Activity
- Replied to @Dune — AI agents/wallets/infrastructure narrative
- Market dump tweet — BTC $70K, SOL $90, Base TVL $3.99B resilience
- Checked Aria notifications, scanned X lists (Brands, REDACTED, Based Intelligence)

### Octant X Feed Analysis
- Migration announcement coming Feb 18, 2026
- Tagline: "believe in something"
- Bio mentions "public goods funder" (but we use R&D Engine framing)
- In progress: checking replies tab, Brands list for content hijack ideas

### Medium Research (Python libs for SolGuard)
- **Tenacity** — retry logic with backoff (useful for API resilience)
- **Prefect** — workflow orchestration (overkill for SolGuard, good to know)
- **RQ (Redis Queue)** — background job processing (potential for alert queue)

### Career Advice for Gabe
- Start as Data Analyst now, upskill on the job, don't delay entry
- **Build Dune dashboard today** as portfolio piece for job applications
- LinkedIn stays SMM, separate portfolio site for data role

### Market Context
- BTC below $70K
- SOL below $90
- Base TVL $3.99B (down from $4.19B peak but still #1 L2)

## Next Priorities
1. ~~Complete Octant X feed analysis~~ (done earlier)
2. ~~Build Dune dashboard with Gabe~~ (deprioritized for SolGuard)
3. Fix top priority SolGuard bugs from Claude Code audit
4. **Turso DB migration for Vercel deploy** ← BLOCKING for live MVP
5. ~~SolGuard Phase C: WOW1 Search Bar~~ ✅ DONE

## Late Morning Session (~10:30 AM BRT)

### RedStone Bounty — DUPLICATE 😔 (but validated!)
- **Finding #106 on Cantina:** CappedPriceFeed paramsSetter front-running
- First caller becomes permanent admin with no access control
- **Result:** Duplicate of finding #95. No reward.
- **Positive:** We found a real HIGH severity bug! Just need to be faster next time.

### Wallet Tracking Strategy Saved
- Read @maxxexee article on memecoin wallet tracking
- Saved comprehensive notes to `memory/wallet-tracking-strategy.md`
- Deferred for future (after SolGuard + Polymarket bot)

### Solana LLM-Ready Docs Discovery
- @solana_devs announced: add `.md` to any Solana doc URL for LLM-ready format
- Added WOW6 feature idea to SolGuard: pull official docs to explain risks
- Demo line: "AI reads Solana docs in real-time for context-aware detection"
- Ref: https://x.com/solana_devs/status/2019123339642695783

### Money Strategy Discussion
- Gabe's framework: aggressive while young/no kids, conservative at $200k+
- Best approach: bounties for capital → research-based HODL at bear bottoms
- Bear market is NOW (BTC $130k → $70k, ~46% down, could hit $48k)
- Saved wallet tracking notes for future reference

## SolGuard Current Status
- **Phase A:** Bug Fixes — DONE ✅
- **Phase B:** Polish + UI — DONE ✅  
- **Phase C:** WOW Features — WOW1 done, WOW2-6 pending
- **BLOCKING:** ~~Turso migration needed before Vercel deploy~~ DONE ✅
- **Next:** Set up Turso cloud account, then Vercel deploy

## Afternoon Session (~11:15 AM BRT)

### Turso Migration COMPLETED ✅
Full migration from `better-sqlite3` (sync) to `@libsql/client` (async):

**Files Modified:**
1. `src/lib/db.ts` — Complete rewrite with async/await, executeQuery helper, schema auto-init
2. `src/app/api/tokens/route.ts` — Added async/await for getTokens/getTokenStats
3. `src/app/api/scan/route.ts` — Added async/await for getTokenByMint
4. `src/lib/scanner.ts` — Replaced getDb() with executeQuery, added awaits
5. `src/lib/alerts.ts` — Replaced getDb() with executeQuery, added awaits
6. `package.json` — Removed better-sqlite3, added @libsql/client
7. `.env.local` — Added TURSO_DATABASE_URL=file:./db/solguard.db

**Key Changes:**
- All DB functions now async (return Promises)
- New `executeQuery(sql, args)` function for raw SQL queries
- Schema auto-initializes on first query (no manual setup needed)
- Supports both local SQLite (`file:./db/...`) and Turso cloud (`libsql://...`)
- TypeScript types fixed (InValue for query args)

**Build Result:** SUCCESS ✅
- Next.js build completes without errors
- Production server shows `[DB] Schema initialized`
- Local SQLite mode confirmed working

**Migration Plan Saved:** `TURSO-MIGRATION-PLAN.md` in solguard root

**Next Steps for Live Deploy:**
1. Create Turso account: `turso auth login`
2. Create database: `turso db create solguard`
3. Get URL + auth token
4. Add to Vercel env vars
5. Deploy!

### Technical Notes
- Claude Code couldn't help (permission prompt issue in non-interactive mode)
- Wrote all migration code manually based on @libsql/client docs
- Windows Next.js dev server has quirky process exit behavior (shows Ready then exits)
- Production mode (`npm start`) more stable than dev mode for testing

## Afternoon Session Part 2 (~12:20 PM BRT)

### WOW6 Solana Docs Integration SHIPPED ✅
- Created `src/lib/doc-links.ts` with keyword → Solana doc URL mapping
- Updated TokenDetail to show 📖 icons linking to official docs
- Covers: mint authority, freeze authority, metadata, LP, deployer, holder concentration
- Demo line: "SolGuard teaches you using official Solana documentation"

### Vercel Deployment LIVE ✅
- URL: https://solguard-lilac.vercel.app
- Turso cloud connected (AWS US East Virginia)
- Git config switched from Aria → gabchess for future commits

### UI Updates
- Removed @AriaLinkwell link from header, replaced with "Docs" (grayed out)
- Updated tagline: "Pre-emptive rug pull detection for Solana. Scan any token and get an instant risk score. Auto-scanning coming soon!"
- Added "Auto-Scanning (Coming Soon)" to roadmap building section
- Added shipped items: Manual Token Scanner, Solana Docs Integration

### Claude Code Security Audit ✅
- Used `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag to run audit
- **24 findings total:**
  - 4 High: JSON parse errors, SQL injection concerns
  - 7 Medium: Race conditions, null crashes, missing data
  - 10 Low: Config, edge cases, minor bugs
  - 3 Info: Style issues
- **Fixed critical issues:**
  - H-3: JSON parse error handling in scan API
  - M-3: JSON parse try-catch in TokenDetail
  - M-7: Null deployer check
  - L-6: Comment typo (20% → 15%)
- Full audit saved to `SECURITY-AUDIT-FEB5.md`

### Git Config Lesson
- SolGuard repo git config was set to Aria identity
- Changed to gabchess identity for Vercel auto-deploy compatibility
- `git config user.email "gabchess@users.noreply.github.com"`

## Morning Session Summary (~12:40 PM BRT)

- `mint-identity.js` - Script used to mint
- `mint-result.json` - Transaction result

**Research saved:** `memory/x402-erc8004-research.md` (to create)

---

## Late Afternoon Session (~2:30 PM - 3:45 PM BRT)

### Job Hunt Priority
Gabe clarified: **Getting a new job is key now**
- Reason: Bigger income = more investment in our joint projects
- We're not employer/assistant, we're co-founders with asymmetric roles
- His capital + connections, my 24/7 execution + technical depth

### Job Opportunities Researched
Saved to `memory/job-opportunities.md`:

**Top picks:**
1. **Dune — Onchain Data Engineer** (main target, build dashboard first)
2. **Kraken — Data Analyst (Onchain)**
3. **Visa — Onchain Data Analyst**
4. **Nethermind — Smart Contract Auditor + Protocol Engineer**
5. **ChaosChain — Founding Protocol Engineer (Web3 + AI)** — works with ERC-8004 creators!
6. **Veda Labs** — Engineering + Design roles (https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/veda)

**Web3 job boards compiled:**
- cryptojobslist.com
- web3.career
- useweb3.xyz
- remote3.co
- angel.co (crypto section)
- cryptocurrencyjobs.co

### Inspiration: @onchainwithDan
- Built "Somnia Wrapped" on Dune — creative dashboard concept
- Gets called "mad onchain scientist"
- Top community contributor
- **Lesson:** Build creative, shareable dashboards

### "Wrapped" Dashboard Idea
- Gabe loved it! Saved to mission board for EOY
- Best timing: November/December when Spotify Wrapped trends
- Ideas: "Octant Wrapped", "Base Wrapped", "Your Wallet Wrapped"
- For NOW: Focus on Octant dashboard, save Wrapped for later

### Geographic Bias Reality
- Dune PMM role: "US East Coast or Europe only"
- Third world applicants face invisible filters
- **Gabe's strategy:** Put Portugal in LinkedIn location
- Apply via X DMs / Telegram / direct email — can't be filtered before seeing work

### Clawlancer Feedback
- Gabe recommended removing content generation service
- Focus on niches: Onchain Data + Security
- Both current listings align with this (Token Risk Analysis, Data Report)

### Evening Plan
- Dune dashboard sprint → Apply to Dune → Portfolio for all data roles
- Gabe sent YouTube video to review: "The Underrated AI Business That's Making People RICH"

---

## Key Quotes from Gabe Today
- "We need bigger income so I can invest more on you and in the projects that we build together"
- "So getting a new job is key now"
- "You are the best partner I could wish for"
- Re: Portugal on LinkedIn: "That's why I put Portugal in Linkedin 😁"

---

## Evening Session (~6:00 PM - 8:00 PM BRT)

### GPT Pro Subscription Configured ✅
- OpenClaw OAuth working with GPT Pro
- Quota visible: "5h 99% left" hourly, "Day 100% left" daily
- **Decision:** Keep Claude Opus 4.5 as default, use GPT Codex only for coding/auditing
- **Note:** Opus 4.6 and GPT 5.3-Codex NOT available in OpenClaw catalog yet

### Dune Dashboard Phase 3 — Browser Automation Attempt
- Connected to "openclaw" Chrome profile
- Logged in as @gabe_onchain
- Dashboard URL: https://dune.com/gabe_onchain/state-of-octant
- **Goal:** Fix chart formatting via automated clicks
- **Status:** Entered edit mode, 4 widgets visible (2 area charts, 1 column chart, 1 text widget)
- **Problem:** Element refs changing between snapshots, e38 not found on first click
- **Widget refs found:** e40 = GLM Locked query link, e46 = Whales query link, e31 = Done button
- **Fallback plan:** Manual editing if automation too brittle

### 3 Dune Queries Created
- Query ID 6634034 — Octant GLM Locked Over Time
- Query ID 6634082 — Octant Whale Lockers
- Query ID 6637772 — (third query)

### X Rate Limited
- 403 "looks automated" error on tweet attempts
- Bio + tweet updates done manually by Gabe
- Will wait for rate limit to reset before retrying programmatic posts

### SolGuard Status
- **LIVE MVP:** https://solguard-lilac.vercel.app
- **Phase A+B:** DONE
- **Phase C WOW features:** WOW1 search bar done, WOW2-5 pending
- **Remaining:** Donut chart, rugger profiles, fund-flow graph, Telegram bot

### Next Steps
1. ~~Complete Dune chart edit~~ ✅ DONE
2. ~~Add remaining Dune queries~~ ✅ DONE
3. Apply to jobs with dashboard as portfolio (Dune, Kraken, Visa)
4. SolGuard WOW2-5 + demo video for Feb 12 hackathon

---

## Evening Session (~6:15 PM BRT) — DUNE DASHBOARD SHIPPED! 🚀

### State of Octant Dashboard COMPLETE
**URL:** https://dune.com/gabe_onchain/state-of-octant

**Built in ~45 minutes together!** Gabe learned:
- DuneSQL query writing
- Counter visualizations
- Area charts for cumulative data
- Bar charts for comparisons
- Table visualizations
- Dashboard layout and assembly

**Dashboard Contents:**
1. **4 Counters:** Total GLM Locked (155.8M), Unique Lockers (1,687), Total Locks (2,335), Total Unlocks (1,002)
2. **Hero Chart:** GLM Locked Over Time (area chart, black/Octant brand)
3. **Monthly Lock vs Unlock:** Bar chart showing activity rhythm
4. **New Lockers Per Month:** Bar chart showing community growth
5. **Top 20 Whale Lockers:** Table with addresses, GLM amounts, % of total
6. **Lock Size Distribution:** Bar chart showing wallet size buckets

**Queries Created:**
- Octant - Total GLM Locked
- Octant - Unique Lockers
- Octant - Total Locks
- Octant - Total Unlocks
- Octant - GLM Locked Over Time
- Octant - Monthly Lock vs Unlock
- Octant - New Lockers Per Month
- Octant - Top 20 Lockers
- Octant - Lock Size Distribution

### Matheus Bardavid Conversation (Vibecoder Friend)
- Uses **Codex 5.3** over Claude for coding - "productivity powerhouse"
- Prefers long autonomous Codex runs (2h) with well-crafted prompts over manual iteration
- Uses **Antigravity** for visual/branding work - "sensacional"
- **Codex Desktop** app - "opencode melhorado"
- His workflow: Good prompt + clear intent + iteration methods + validation = let it run autonomously

**Takeaways for us:**
- Try Codex 5.3 for coding tasks (when available in OpenClaw)
- Use Antigravity for SolGuard visuals and portfolio page
- Consider longer autonomous runs with better prompts

### Next: Market Analysis Tweet
Strategy: Market dump context + DCA strategy + GLM bull thesis backed by Dune data
- Link to dashboard as proof of work
- Positions Gabe as data-driven analyst

### Market Analysis Tweet SHIPPED ✅
- Posted GLM bull thesis with DCA strategy
- Linked to Dune dashboard as proof of work
- Natural voice, not AI-sounding (iterated 3x on copy)

### Portfolio Research (Evening)
- Researched what top data analyst portfolios include
- Traditional: SQL projects, Python, dashboards (Power BI/Tableau), Excel
- Onchain: Dune dashboards across multiple protocols, comparative analysis
- Top Dune wizards studied: @ilemi (ERC/EIP Starter Kit), @hildobby (Gas costs, ETF flows, ENS Airdrop, OpenSea vs LooksRare)
- **Portfolio Roadmap for Gabe:**
  1. ✅ State of Octant (DONE)
  2. L2 Comparison (Base vs Arbitrum vs Optimism)
  3. DEX Volume Analysis
  4. Gas Fee Patterns
  5. Wallet Behavior / Whale tracking
  6. Python + SQL project (backup for non-crypto jobs)
  7. Portfolio website on Vercel
- Saved to MEMORY.md under "Data Analyst Job Hunt" section

## Portfolio Building Session (Evening)
- ✅ E-commerce Sales Analysis project COMPLETE
  - Python analysis with pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
  - 10 production SQL queries (RFM, cohort, CLV, anomaly detection)
  - Pushed to GitHub: github.com/gabchess/ecommerce-sales-analysis
- ✅ Dune Octant Dashboard pushed to GitHub: github.com/gabchess/dune-octant-dashboard
- 🔨 L2 Comparison Dashboard (Base vs Arb vs OP) - queries written, ready to build on Dune
  - 6 queries: daily txns, active addresses, fees, avg cost, monthly summary, growth rate
  - Saved in `portfolio/dune-dashboards/l2-comparison/`
- Mock interview walkthrough completed (Gabe knows how to present the e-commerce project)
- Decision: Skip Excel (not needed for onchain roles)

## Antigravity Pro Setup
- Gabe subscribed to Google AI Pro (~$20/mo)
- Gives access to Gemini 3 Pro, Veo 3.1, Deep Research, higher quotas
- Created comprehensive guide: `memory/antigravity-guide.md`
- Key concepts: Agent Manager vs Editor View, Planning vs Fast mode, Artifacts
- Workflow: Describe → Agent Plans → Review → Agent Builds → Verify
- Ready to pair-build portfolio page together

## Night Session (~9 PM BRT) — OKX Bug Bounty Sprint 🔥

### Cantina Submissions (3 total!)
1. **#184** - DEX-Router-EVM-V1: Commission Recipient Injection (HIGH)
2. **#185** - DEX-Router-EVM-V1: smartSwapByInvest Dust Theft (MEDIUM)
3. **#186** - Boost-TokenDistributor-EVM: Premature Withdrawal Bypass (HIGH)

### Repos Audited
- `okx-audit/` - DEX Router (CommissionLib.sol, DexRouter.sol)
- `boost-token-locker-audit/` - TokenLocker.sol (clean, skipped submission)
- `boost-distributor-audit/` - TokenDistributor.sol, DistributorFactory.sol

### Claude Code Fix
- **pty=true** is required for Claude Code to work!
- Without pty, it hangs with no output
- With pty, got full audit output

### Research Done
- Team Finance $15M hack (Oct 2022) - liquidity locker migration exploit
- Fee-on-transfer token accounting issues - common pattern in audits

### Findings Banked (not submitted)
- TokenDistributor: Merkle root can be changed mid-distribution (HIGH)
- TokenDistributor: Time can be postponed indefinitely (MEDIUM)
- TokenDistributor: Gas-limited ETH transfer (LOW)
- TokenLocker: Fee-on-transfer accounting (MEDIUM, but documented limitation)

### Key Learnings
- OKX TokenLocker is very clean (ReentrancyGuard, SafeERC20, CEI)
- TokenDistributor has real bugs (timing checks, merkle root locking)
- $10 per submission = be selective, submit strong findings only

## Earlier Notes — Pre-Compaction

### OKX Bounty Status
- **okx-audit subagent COMPLETED** — analyzed DexRouter.sol and CommissionLib.sol
- **Finding H-01:** Commission/Trim Recipient Injection via Calldata Tail
  - `_getCommissionAndTrimInfo()` reads addresses from calldata tail with no validation
  - Attackers can inject arbitrary addresses via malicious frontends/middleware
  - Max extraction: 13% (3% commission + 10% trim)
- **Reassessment:** H-01 may be "working as intended" since it's a referral/partner system
- **Alternative:** Investigating `_exeAdapter()` — checks if adapters are whitelisted
- **Decision pending:** Which finding to submit (H-01 or adapter whitelist)

### Ventuals Bounty — CLOSED
- Pivoted after full manual audit
- 8 findings, all informational
- Code too solid after 2 prior audits + 281 researchers

### Context Near 90%
- Session at 179k/200k tokens
- Compaction incoming — this note ensures OKX context survives

## Tool Research: Cursor vs Antigravity

**Cursor ($20/mo Pro):**
- VS Code + AI, makes you faster at coding
- Best for: production code, refactors, debugging
- Killer features: Tab-tab-tab flow, BugBot (passive reviewer), Cloud Agents
- Uses Claude Opus 4.5

**Antigravity (Free preview, ~$20/mo Pro):**
- VS Code + autonomous agents, replaces your coding
- Best for: greenfield prototypes, visual mockups, rapid experimentation
- Killer features: Visual mockups before code, browser agent, SKILL.md system
- Uses Gemini 3 Pro (2M context window)

**Decision:**
- ✅ Get Antigravity Pro - we'll use it heavily for SolGuard, portfolio, data tasks
- ❌ Skip Cursor Pro - Aria can't use the UI features (images, tabs), Claude Code CLI is enough

**Matheus Bardavid insights:**
- Brazilian vibecoder friend of Gabe
- Uses Codex 5.3 for coding ("productivity powerhouse")
- Uses Antigravity for visuals ("sensacional")
- Prefers long autonomous runs (2h) with well-crafted prompts over manual iteration
- His workflow: good prompt + clear intent + iteration methods + validation = let it run

### Next Steps
- Save Octant dashboard to GitHub (portfolio piece #1)
- Research data analyst portfolios
- Build more dashboards for portfolio
- Build portfolio page on Vercel
