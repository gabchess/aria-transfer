# From Epochs to Forevers. Welcome to the Octant App.

---

Over the past 2.5 years, thousands of you have participated in our Octant v1 Epochs. Together you've pushed millions of dollars in matching funding toward the projects and causes that matter most to you. All of it on a 90-day clock.

That clock served us well through 10 epochs. But we kept hearing the same thing.

"Why can't I just stake when I'm ready?"

Fair question. Let's get into it.

## How staking works today

Quick crash course. An epoch lasts roughly 90 days. You lock GLM, wait for the allocation window, decide which projects get funded, collect your ETH rewards, repeat. Everyone on the same clock. Same start, same end.

Straightforward. Predictable. But predictable comes with trade-offs.

Lock your GLM on day 45? You're earning roughly half of what day-one stakers get. Miss the allocation window because life happened? Your rewards default away from the projects you wanted to support. The clock doesn't wait for you.

## What's changing

The Octant App removes the epoch calendar from staking entirely.

Stake your GLM whenever you want. Unstake whenever you want. Earn WETH rewards continuously while your tokens are in the contract. No 90-day cycles. No allocation windows to miss. No penalties for showing up late.

Rewards accumulate continuously over 30-day cycles. Your share is proportional to your stake relative to everyone else in the pool. No minimum. 1 GLM staked = 1 unit of earning power. Simple.

Epochs were a bus schedule. The bus left every 90 days whether you were on it or not. The Octant App runs on your schedule.

## What stays the same

You're still locking GLM to earn individual rewards. Those rewards still represent your voting power in future Golem Foundation funding rounds. You can claim and withdraw them whenever they accrue.

The first v2 funding rounds are still a few months out. Until they launch, you get to start accumulating rewards in the new model. But when rounds launch, this becomes your single access point to everything: quadratic funding, community rounds, streaming experiments like StreamVote, all from one application.

## Migrating from v1

Epoch 11 will be a Migration Epoch. Your goal is simple: move your GLM lock from v1 into v2. Three on-chain transactions.

1. Unlock your GLM from v1
2. Approve the token allowance
3. Lock into v2

Rewards start accumulating the moment you migrate. Already have a v2 position? The migration increases your existing balance. One address, one position.

After the migration period, v1 moves toward sunset. You'll still be able to access v1 to withdraw, but GLM in v1 will no longer earn rewards.

## Why this matters beyond Golem

Here's the part that gets us excited.

This system is no longer specific to Golem Foundation. Any ecosystem or community can deploy the same infrastructure with their own tokens and funding parameters. A DAO funding local builders. A protocol distributing grants to contributors. A community running preference votes on chain.

Maybe this time next year, you'll be participating in multiple Octant v2 implementations across different ecosystems, proving that sustainable funding and high-quality preference aggregation can co-exist in web3 and beyond.

## Ready to migrate?

We'll share the exact timeline soon. When the Migration Epoch opens, head to the Octant App to move your GLM. Three transactions, a few minutes, and you're earning on your own terms.
