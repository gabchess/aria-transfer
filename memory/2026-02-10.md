## Still Due Tomorrow (Feb 11)
- PM Task 2: Dev Meeting Notes Template
- PM Task 3: AI Workflow for Marketing Team

## Late Evening Updates
- **Scanner cron env fix** — Evening 9PM cron failed (SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY missing). Updated both morning + evening crons to pass env vars inline instead of relying on .env file
- **Mashal 1-on-1 meeting** — Gabe forgot to record it. Two asks from Mashal:
  1. Future reports: include more ecosystem accounts (Solana, Ethereum, Arb) — needs confirmation on exact scope
  2. Gather influential DeFi folks to invite to Luma event: https://luma.com/txjyzesb?tk=iArgDq
  - CSV of 28 past event applicants saved and parsed → `memory/mashal-meeting-tasks-feb10.md`
  - Top targets: Austin Griffith (EF), Vinay Vasanji (EF), Francesco Renzi (Superfluid), Monet Supply (Spark), Joao Reginatto (M0/ex-Circle), TokenBrice (DeFiScan)
- **Durgadas situation** — Wants to collab on AI agents, showed vibe-coded donor dashboard. Gabe deflected to Thursday async review
- **Octant Labs email** — Marek redirected to @jesiotr for Octant Labs emails. Message sent in team chat
- **V1→V2 Migration Hub sent to Mashal** ✅ — Clean message crafted and sent
- **Gabe called it a day ~10 PM BRT** — Incredible productivity day, very happy with partnership

## Learnings & System Improvements
- **Multi-agent shared brain:** If we ever run multiple OpenClaw agents, they MUST share one workspace/memory directory. Siloed agents = "collectively braindead" (via @ericosiu). Our current architecture already supports this with MEMORY.md + memory/ folder.
- **Our framework is ahead of the curve:** People are tweeting folder structures as breakthroughs. We already have SOUL/USER/DNA/MEMORY/HEARTBEAT from the kloss_xyz framework. Keep iterating on it.
- **Nitro Accelerator:** $500K/team, 3 months, crypto project accelerator. Bookmarked for future if we ever spin up a standalone product.
- **Cron env vars:** Isolated cron sessions don't inherit .env files. Always pass env vars inline in cron payloads.
- **Helius Wallet API (Beta):** One-call Solana wallet intelligence (first txn, funding source, transfers, balances, full history). Game-changer for SolGuard rugger detection. Free tier. Backlogged.
- **Nitro Accelerator:** $500K/3mo crypto accelerator. Plan: SolGuard agent swarm with Aria as CEO, transparent about AI. Backlogged.
- **Octant Card Campaign:** Approved vibecoding project. Personalized impact cards tied to v1→v2 migration. LoTR theme, on-brand. Claude Code brainstorming on Mac.

## Workflow
- Running 3 AI agents in parallel: Aria (coordination), Claude Code (audits), Cursor (building)
- Gabe coordinating and submitting while agents cook

## Euler F-02 Details
- Title: "EulerSwap reserve tracking ignores interest accrual, causing silent insolvency"
- Root cause: SwapLib.finish() updates reserves with swap amounts only, ignores interest
- Impact: tracked reserves 6.09x overstated at 180 days, full liquidation at 2 years (50% APR)
- 5 PoC scenarios: drift quantified, silent insolvency, false signals, asymmetric liquidity, full insolvency+liquidation
- Custom 50% APR IRM for stress test
- Submission formatted to Cantina template (Summary, Finding, Impact, Likelihood, PoC, Recommendation)

## Narrative Tracker Data
- New Supabase project: btkkaayncmmkouhsaxcr
- Narratives generated: AI Agents (90%), Mobile Adoption (85%), MEV/JitoSOL (80%), Perp Trading (75%)
- Some GitHub repos 404: jupiter-core, sanctum-solana-program, squadsprotocol/v4, switchboard, pyth-sdk-solana
