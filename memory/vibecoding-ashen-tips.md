## Planning & Prompting
1. **Perfect your prompt BEFORE coding** - Don't rush into building
2. **Use Whisper AI for voice-to-text** - Faster than typing long prompts
3. **Context is EVERYTHING** - More context = better output
4. **Answer Claude's follow-up questions** - Don't skip them, they matter

## Model & Tools
5. **Use Claude Opus 4.5** - "best AI model" for vibecoding
6. **Claude Pro ($20/mo) is worth it** - Pay for quality
7. **Always use Plan Mode BEFORE Build Mode** - Let AI think first
8. **Use Design Mode for front-end only** - Don't mix concerns

## Productivity Hacks
9. **DON'T change AI-generated code manually** - Ask Claude to fix it instead
10. **Stay productive while agent builds** - Plan next features, research, etc.
11. **Keep Claude open for parallel planning** - Use wait time wisely
12. **Run multiple agents simultaneously** - Parallelize work

## Project Setup
13. **Create MD files (Replit.md & Claude.md)** - Project context files (like our AGENTS.md)
14. **Use Skills.sh for additional guidelines** - Extend agent capabilities
15. **Install front-end design skills** - Specialized skills for UI work

## Testing & Iteration
16. **Test your website every 5-10 prompts** - Don't let bugs compound
17. **Be SPECIFIC when reporting bugs** - Vague = bad fixes

## Shipping
18. **Set up GitHub for version control** - Track changes, revert if needed
19. **Share & get feedback / Build in public** - Accountability + ideas
20. **Create shortcuts (/start and /done commands)** - Automate repetitive prompts

## Key Takeaways for Us
- We already do most of this (AGENTS.md, parallel agents, GitHub)
- NEW: Test every 5-10 prompts (we sometimes go longer)
- NEW: Never manually edit AI code (always ask Claude to fix)
- NEW: /start and /done shortcuts (add to our workflow)
