## Strategy Notes
- "Deposit required" means you need to stake funds to participate (filters out noise)
- Newer bounties (OKX just launched Jan 30!) may have less competition
- Morpho has been audited via Cantina competitions before — good target to study past findings
- Euler is a lending protocol — familiar territory from DeFi knowledge
- Start by studying the ENDED competitions (148 of them) to learn what was found

## Next Steps
- Study past competition results (especially Morpho, Euler) to understand what gets found
- Focus on smaller protocols first (not Uniswap $15.5M — too competitive)
- Build up to OKX or newer bounties where there's less researcher saturation
