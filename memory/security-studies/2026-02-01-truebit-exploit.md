# Truebit $26M Exploit — Post-Mortem Study

**Date:** January 8, 2026
**Protocol:** Truebit (TRU) — offline computation protocol on Ethereum
**Loss:** $26.44M (8,535 ETH)
**Source:** SlowMist analysis

## Vulnerability: Integer Overflow in Purchase Contract

### Root Cause
- Truebit's Purchase contract calculated the ETH cost for minting TRU tokens
- The contract used Solidity **v0.6.10** — a version WITHOUT built-in overflow checks
- An addition operation overflowed uint256 max value, wrapping around to near-zero
- This meant tokens could be minted at virtually zero cost

### Attack Flow
1. Attacker calls Purchase contract with crafted parameters
2. Cost calculation overflows → returns ~0 ETH required
3. Attacker mints massive amounts of TRU for almost nothing
4. Drains 8,535 ETH ($26.44M) from protocol reserves
5. TRU price crashes 99%

### Key Lessons
1. **Solidity version matters** — v0.6.10 lacks SafeMath by default. Solidity 0.8+ has built-in overflow protection
2. **Old protocols = legacy risk** — Truebit launched April 2021, vulnerability existed for 5+ years
3. **Integer overflow is STILL a thing** — even after all the awareness, old contracts remain vulnerable
4. **Audit age matters** — a contract audited in 2021 may have been fine then, but auditing standards evolve

### Audit Checklist Item
- [ ] Check Solidity version — is it < 0.8.0?
- [ ] If < 0.8.0, does it use SafeMath or similar overflow protection?
- [ ] Are there arithmetic operations on user-controlled inputs?
- [ ] Can any calculation wrap around to produce unexpected values?

### Stats (from SlowMist 2025 report)
- Contract vulnerabilities: 30.5% of all crypto exploits in 2025
- 56 reported incidents from contract flaws
- AI models (Claude Opus 4.5, Sonnet 4.5, GPT-5) collectively found $4.6M in exploits during controlled testing — interesting for our bug bounty work!
