# Slither Static Analysis Tool - Study Notes (2026-02-03)

Slither is a static analysis framework for Solidity and Vyper smart contracts, written in Python 3. It's designed to help developers find vulnerabilities, enhance code comprehension, and quickly prototype custom analyses.

**Key Features:**

*   Detects vulnerable Solidity code with low false positives.
*   Identifies the error location in the source code.
*   Integrates into CI and Hardhat/Foundry builds.
*   Provides built-in printers for quick contract information reporting.
*   Offers a Detector API for writing custom analyses in Python.
*   Supports Solidity >= 0.4 and Vyper.
*   Uses an intermediate representation (SlithIR) for high-precision analyses.

**Installation:**

Slither requires Python 3.10+. Installation methods include:

*   **uv** (recommended): The fastest method.
    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    uv tool install slither-analyzer
    ```
*   **Pip:** Standard Python package manager.
    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install slither-analyzer
    ```
*   **Brew:** For macOS users.
    ```bash
    brew install slither-analyzer
    ```
*   **Git (Development):** For contributing or using the latest unreleased version.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/crytic/slither.git && cd slither
    uv tool install -e .
    ```
*   **Docker:** Using the eth-security-toolbox image.
    ```bash
    docker pull trailofbits/eth-security-toolbox
    docker run -it -v /home/share:/share trailofbits/eth-security-toolbox
    ```

**Key Detectors (Examples):**

Slither comes with a wide range of built-in detectors, categorized by impact and confidence. Here are a few examples:

*   `reentrancy-eth`: Reentrancy vulnerabilities (theft of ethers) - High Impact, Medium Confidence
*   `uninitialized-state`: Uninitialized state variables - High Impact, High Confidence
*   `suicidal`: Functions allowing anyone to destruct the contract - High Impact, High Confidence
*   `arbitrary-send-eth`: Functions that send Ether to arbitrary destinations - High Impact, Medium Confidence
*   `delegatecall-loop`: Payable functions using delegatecall inside a loop - High Impact, Medium Confidence
* `timestamp`: Dangerous usage of block.timestamp - Low Impact, Medium Confidence

**Usage:**

To run Slither, simply navigate to your Hardhat/Foundry project and run:

```bash
slither .
```

For single files without dependencies:

```bash
slither contract.sol
```
