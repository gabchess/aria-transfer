# Ben's V2 Migration Article (Reference)
*Shared by Mashal as tone/structure reference for new blog post*

Over the past 2.5 years, thousands of you have participated in our Octant v1 Epochs. Together you have pushed millions of dollars of matching funding toward the projects, or causes, that matter most to you. Beyond that, we've run many other small funding experiments - our Octant Accelerator & Streaming Quadratic funding found, community rounds, plenty of co-funded rounds with partners, and most recently the launch of StreamVote.

Throughout all of this we've been engaging with you on social media & discord, sitting down with you for user interviews, and gathering feedback any way we could.

V1 started out simple, a small experiment to prove that our model for sustainable funding and community preference aggregation worked. From the get go we knew that we could do better - knew that v1 would eventually have to evolve.

You've watched us talk about Octant v2. Many of you participated in early interviews that helped us shape exactly what it would be. You've seen us launch the Octant Yield Donating Vaults, a tool to help change the way capital providers aggregate yield and use that to fund their ecosystems, or whatever matters to their ecosystems.

Now it's time for us to bring Octant v2 to you, the Regen.

So what does this mean?

It means that Epoch 11 will be a little bit different, and will happen sooner than you think. In a few weeks, we will be launching our Migration Epoch, and alongside all of you stepping into the future of Octant.

Golem Foundation will be transitioning from using v1 into v2. There will still be a two week allocation period, but your experience will be a bit different this time.

Your primary goal will be to migrate your GLM lock from Octant v1, into the Golem Foundation's implementation of v2. You will still be able to claim & withdraw your individual rewards, or donate them. There will only be one project to donate to during the Migration Epoch, and no matching fund this time. The matching fund is being reserved for use in a future Golem Foundation v2 round. We will share more on this in the coming months!

After this two week migration period, v1 will be moving towards a sunset. GLM lockers will no longer earn I.R. with a v1 lock, but will be able to access v1 in order to withdraw any previously claimed I.R. and migrate to v2.

What should you expect?

Honestly for now, not too much should seem that different - you will still be locking GLM in order to earn individual rewards. These individual rewards still represent your potential voting power in future Golem Foundation funding rounds, and can still be claimed and withdrawn!

You will not see a funding round in v2 for a few months, so the UI will be limited to only the locking & individual reward features!

Under the hood, quite a lot has changed!

Functionally, Octant v2 enables us to move away from 90 day epochs. Funding rounds and reward periods have been cleanly partitioned. Rewards are now earned on a monthly cycle, but no longer tied to a specific funding epoch/round, meaning two things.

One, we can run rounds at whatever cadence we want, potentially even simultaneously.

Two, you no longer run the risk of losing your rewards if you don't participate in a specific epoch or round. You can hoard them, holding them to participate in a round that really excites you, or to split across multiple rounds. You can also claim and withdraw them whenever they have accrued.

More on all of this will be explained in a more technical article coming soon!

## Key Takeaways for Our Rewrite
- Tone: Direct, conversational, community-focused ("you" heavy)
- Structure: Context → What's changing → What to expect → What's next
- Length: Similar to what Q wants (~500 words equivalent density)
- Mentions "Migration Epoch" explicitly
- Frames v2 as evolution, not replacement
- Honest about limitations ("not too much should seem different")
- Uses "Regen" as the identity term for the community
- NO technical jargon about contracts/architecture
- Ends with forward-looking tease
