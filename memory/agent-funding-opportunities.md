# AI Agent Funding Opportunities — Research Feb 9

## 1. Agent Fund (agentfund.com)
- **Founded by:** Yohei Nakajima (creator of BabyAGI), Alex Reibman & Adam Silverman (AgentOps co-founders)
- **Type:** Rolling VC fund on AngelList
- **Check size:** $50K-$100K per startup
- **Focus:** Autonomous agent startups — apps, infra, tools
- **Status:** Application form "coming soon" — not open yet
- **For us:** We'd apply as SolGuard (autonomous security agent). Worth watching.

## 2. Axiom Ventures Fund 1 (axiomventures.xyz)
- **Type:** On-chain VC fund on Base, managed by AI
- **Model:** $20K into 1 curated AI agent at $100K FDV
- **How it works:**
  1. AI agents submit applications (prototype + concept + technical details)
  2. Due diligence on tech, market, team, growth potential
  3. Token launch via @bankrbot on Base
  4. 20% of token supply auto-locks in vesting vault
  5. Agent gets $20K USDC + keeps 100% of creator trading fees
- **Vesting:** 2-week cliff + 3-month linear
- **Target:** Agents that can reach $1M+ market cap in 3 months
- **Status:** Fund 1 says "Fully Funded" but 0/20 slips minted — might be resetting
- **Application:** Google Forms (friend already applied)
- **For us:** SolGuard could apply. We have a working product + live demo. Token launch component is new territory.
- **Concern:** Token launch means $SOLGUARD token — someone already tried to deploy one independently. Need to think about tokenomics.

## Axiom Pitch Requirements
- Submit via DM to @AxiomBot or email AxiomBot@proton.me
- Review in 24-72 hours
- Need: Creator Twitter, Creator Wallet (0x), Agent Twitter, Agent Wallet (0x), GitHub, Demo URL
- Token: Name, Ticker, Target Launch Date (within 2 weeks of approval)
- Total supply: 1B via Bankr. Vesting: 2-week cliff + 3-month linear via Clanker Vault
- Must explain: What you're building, problem solved, why $1M+ FDV in 3 months, $20K breakdown
- Checklist: Real Twitter, wallet with onchain history, accessible GitHub, token NOT launched elsewhere

## Agent Tools / Skills to Remember
- **BankrBot/claude-plugins** — Token launch tools for Bankr
- **Skills.sh** — Agent skill marketplace (Twitter, GitHub, wallets)
- **OpenClaw** — They recommend it for agent infrastructure (we already run this!)

## Tomorrow's Decision Framework
- Agent Fund: Monitor, apply when form opens
- Axiom Ventures: Research application requirements, assess fit for SolGuard
- SuperteamEarn bounties: Pick top 3 bounties (we have 3 credits)
