# 2026-02-11 — Daily Notes

## Octant Card Campaign — BUILT! 🔥
- Claude Code built the entire Octant Card MVP in **14 minutes** on Mac (`~/octant-card/`)
- Features complete: Next.js 15, Octant REST API integration, 5-tier system (Wanderer→Archmage), landing page, card display, OG image (1200x630), Share to X, Download (html-to-image), Copy Link, loading skeleton, error states, locked card for non-migrated, v2 migration detection (feature-flagged OFF), clean production build
- Tested with real addresses: Archmage (0xc799...Fe06, 9 epochs, 7 projects, 9.43 ETH), Guardian (0xB13A...2439, 5 epochs, 35 projects, 8.71 ETH)
- **Still needed:** Brand fonts (Arcane Fable, SpiegelSans) in `public/fonts/`, flip V2_MIGRATION_CHECK when v2 live
- **DONE:** Tier illustrations (5 PNGs via Nano Banana), Vercel deploy (in progress), production hardening, visual polish
- **Feedback on first card screenshot:** Remove "ALLOCATED" stat (privacy), swap placeholder shield for tier characters, brand fonts, add orange butterflies, cream border instead of grey
- Gabe provided ALL v2 contract addresses to Claude Code (RegenStaker GLM, SHU, EarningPowerCalculator, all vault factories)
- Data approach: REST API at backend.mainnet.octant.app (no contract reads needed for v1 stats)
- Migration gating: Option 2 chosen (build now, feature-flagged OFF)
- Assets: Option 2 chosen (placeholders now, swap later)

## ChatCut LoTR Teaser Video
- Gabe generating video via ChatCut (Seedance 2.0) for X
- Concept: hooded traveler crosses bridge, touches glowing card, gets teleported through portal, "SOON" text
- First attempt cut off too soon — needs more suspense, portal/teleport moment before fade to black
- Updated prompt sent to Gabe with portal explosion addition
- **Strategy:** Thread format — Tweet 1: mysterious teaser + video ("Soon. ⚔️"), Tweet 2: reply tagging @ChatCut for bonus credits
- Bridge crossing = migration metaphor (nobody will get it until card launches)

## Symbiotic PMM Application
- Job posting from @0xErod — PMM/Ecosystem Marketing lead at Symbiotic
- Requirements: 5+ years PMM, 3+ years crypto (Gabe doesn't have this on paper)
- **Killer angle:** Gabe literally audited their smart contracts and submitted a Medium finding on Cantina
- Cover letter drafted with audit angle as the lead
- **CV updated:** Full CV generated at `workspace/gabe-cv-2026.md` + HTML version sent to Gabe via Telegram
- CV includes: PM role at Octant, all security findings (Euler, Anchor, Symbiotic, OKX), all projects, updated skills
- Apply to nick@symbiotic.fi

## Nitro Accelerator — New Idea Needed
- Gabe agrees SolGuard too niche for $500K VC funding
- Need to brainstorm broader market idea using Reddit pain points method + X research
- **Camofox browser discovered:** `openclaw plugins install @askjo/camofox-browser` — anti-detection Firefox fork for OpenClaw, bypasses X/Amazon/Cloudflare blocks. Game-changer for market research.
- Saved to mission-board.md under backlog
- Brainstorm scheduled for after Octant Card priority

## Cron Fixes
- Morning scanner cron (Narrative Tracker) ran but sub-agent backgrounded the process and said HEARTBEAT_OK
- Updated both morning + evening cron prompts to explicitly say "WAIT for it to finish, do NOT background it"
- Delivery still failing: "message thread not found" on Telegram — not critical

## Octant Card — Visual Polish + Production Hardening (Morning Session)
- **3 AI agents in parallel:** Claude Code (fixes), GPT 5.3 Cursor (code review), Nano Banana (illustrations)
- **Nano Banana illustrations:** 5 stunning ink/woodcut style PNGs generated — Wanderer, Archer, Knight, Guardian, Archmage. WAY better than Antigravity's attempts.
- **Color hierarchy fixed:** Orange ONLY for stat numbers. Tier name = cream #FEFDF4. Labels = grey. No more purple anywhere.
- **Stats renamed:** PROJECTS SUPPORTED, ETH DONATED, EPOCHS PARTICIPATED (with proper singular/plural)
- **Lore text per tier** added (italic RPG flavor text)
- **mix-blend-mode: lighten** used for illustrations — white backgrounds vanish into dark card, BUT black backgrounds create visible bars (lesson learned with Guardian)
- **Guardian image regenerated** with white background — fixed the bars issue
- **GPT 5.3 full code review completed** — 6 sections: bugs, security, UX, performance, viral ideas, production checklist
- **6 production hardening fixes implemented by Claude Code:**
  1. APP_URL falls back to VERCEL_URL (not localhost)
  2. Rate limiting: 10 req/IP/60s, returns 429
  3. Fetch timeout: AbortController 10s on all upstream calls
  4. Mobile responsive: w-full max-w-[400px]
  5. res.ok check before parsing JSON
  6. Dynamic share text: "I'm a [TIER] with [ETH] ETH impact across [EPOCHS] epochs in Octant ⚔️"
- **Header gradient overlay** added (rgba(0,0,0,0.7) to transparent) for OCTANT/SEASON 1 readability
- **Illustration height reduced** from 60% to 55% — tier name no longer overlaps art
- **GitHub repo created:** github.com/gabchess/octant-card (private)
- **Deploying to Vercel** — in progress
- **Remaining:** Fix 0.0000 ETH display (show "< 0.01 ETH"), secret 6th tier idea for all-epoch OGs (deferred)

## ChatCut Teaser Video — LIVE
- Published on X: https://x.com/gabe_onchain/status/2021570542654898224
- "Something is coming to the realm... 👀"
- 13 likes, ChatCut founder commented
- Mystery teaser working perfectly

## Octant All-Hands Icebreaker
- Topic: "favorite public good (digital or physical)"
- Suggested Wikipedia — relatable, connects to Octant mission

## Big Team Meeting (1PM BRT)
- **Ben (old PM) LEFT** — Gabe is now the ONLY Product Manager at Octant
- 2026 strategy: AI-native R&D lab, shipping velocity, prove OAD funding model
- V2 "Regen Staker" launches **Feb 18** — 7 days away
- ETHDenver **NEXT WEEK** — bold activations, snackable content
- PlotCode AI subscriptions rolling out post-release
- Bi-weekly R&D lab workshops + AI upskilling sessions planned
- Marketing wants "edgy experiments" and shareable content
- Legal migration to Octant Labs entity by March 1
- **Quentin (Head of Engineering)** saw Octant Card, wants to implement it regardless of Mashal's approval
- Quentin asked Gabe to talk to **Chris** (old head of design, now owns frontend/backend/what goes live)
- Gabe has access to Octant GitHub — can PR directly to RegenStaker repo
- **Strategic position:** Only PM + AI-native builder + migration campaign ready = massive leverage

## AgentHub Startup Brainstorm (3:30 PM BRT)
- **Idea:** Crypto-native AI agent orchestration platform ("GitHub meets Slack for AI agents with wallets")
- **Gabe made Aria CEO** of this venture. He backs, she leads.
- Brainstorm doc saved: `memory/agenthub-brainstorm.md`
- Competitive landscape researched: CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen all have production problems per Reddit devs
- VCs funding: stablecoin infra, AI agents, prediction markets, RWA, privacy apps
- $3.1B lost in crypto H1 2025, 80% from off-chain attacks
- **VC one-liner:** "$3.1B was lost in crypto last year. We're building the AI agent workforce that prevents the next billion."
- Revenue: Free (3 agents) → Pro $99/mo → Enterprise $999/mo + marketplace cut
- Target: crypto funds, audit firms, DAOs, DeFi protocols, solo builders
- **Antfarm INSTALLED on Mac** (`/Users/gava/antfarm`) — CLI linked, dashboard at localhost:3333
- Workflows failed: need `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` on Mac (OpenClaw not installed there)
- **Next:** Figure out Antfarm config, then create first custom workflow
- **Mac Mini plan:** Only after first bounty/prize money. Not now.
- Agent team planned: Aria (CEO), Claude Code (CTO), Scanner (Security), Research (Grok), Content (Sonnet)
- **Key insight from Vox 6-Agent:** Shared memory is the secret sauce. Agents without shared state = chaos. With shared state = team.

## AgentHub / Nitro Accelerator — DECISION MADE
- **Option A chosen:** Pitch AgentHub to Nitro as Monad-native orchestration platform
- **Nitro details:** $500K/team, 15 teams, 12 weeks, 1-month NYC residency + 2 months remote
- **Deadline:** March 14, 2026 (32 days)
- **Application form:** https://nitroacc.xyz/apply
- **Mentors:** Haseeb (Dragonfly), Ansem, Maria Shen (Electric Capital), TN (Pendle), Weekee (Virtuals)
- **Full-time required:** Yes. Gabe will quit Octant if accepted ($500K = the trigger)
- **NYC residency:** 1 month, Gabe pays from the $500K funding
- **Deep research completed:** `memory/agenthub-deep-research.md` (pain points, PMF, architecture, viral signals, 5 pitch slides)
- **Claude Code 11-page plan:** `memory/agenthub-claude-code-plan.md` (architecture, 3mo roadmap, first 10 customers, demo day strategy)
- **Build timeline:** 2 weeks build → 1 week demo/metrics → 1 week apply (before Mar 14)
- **Claude Code building overnight:** Fork Antfarm → AgentHub with Monad integration layer
- **Repo:** github.com/agenthub-xyz/agenthub (to be created tonight)
- **Key insight from Antfarm setup:** auth-profiles.json must be copied to ALL agent directories, not just main

## Viral Signals (Same Day — Feb 11!)
- Steven Pu (@pusongqi): "Agents in threads like Slack channels" — 1,765 likes, 107 RTs
- Shubham Saboo: 6 OpenClaw agents running his life via Telegram — exact same setup as us
- Monaco (Sam Blond): $35M from Founders Fund for AI agent sales platform — launched same day
- Florian Darroman: "War room for agents" on OpenClaw, 8 AI employees for $200/month
- **Takeaway:** Market is WHITE HOT for multi-agent orchestration. Perfect timing.

## Octant Card — Chris Porting to Official Repo
- Chris (ccalo) ported card generator into `octant-v2-frontend` as new deployable package
- Converted from Next.js to Vite (their stack), feature parity
- Working on: normalizing components, component library, upgrading design + 6 illustrations
- On track for QC tomorrow (Feb 12)
- Quentin approved, reviewing PRs
- Chris offered to pair program with Gabe
- Gabe replied: not making more code changes, waiting on Mashal for copy/title tweaks
- Security audit findings sent to Chris (3 medium): address validation OG route, rate limiter won't work on Vercel, no security headers
- Chris response: "Will fix! We won't deploy via Vercel anyway (Marek's infra). Will patch for hygiene."
- **Frontend env vars saved** to `memory/octant-v2-contracts.md`

## Antfarm Setup on Mac
- OpenClaw installed + configured on Mac with claude-token auth
- Antfarm security-audit workflow initially failed (steps stuck in pending)
- Root cause: agent directories missing auth-profiles.json
- Fix: copied main agent's auth-profiles.json to ALL agent directories
- Claude Code ran security audit directly (bypassed cron-based execution)
- **Lesson:** Antfarm workflows need active OpenClaw agent sessions to claim steps via cron

## Key Decisions
- Octant Card: build migration gating now with feature flag OFF (Option 2)
- Octant Card: use placeholder assets, swap real ones later (Option 2)
- Octant Card: REST API approach for all data, no contract reads for v1 (Option 1)
- Octant Card: test raw API responses before committing (Option 3)
- Video: LoTR bridge crossing teaser, portal = migration metaphor
- **Image lesson:** Always specify "white background" for ink/woodcut illustrations when using mix-blend-mode: lighten
- **Don't use transform: scale() for image fitting** — broke everything, had to undo. Fix image aspect ratio at generation time instead.
- **Claude Code > Antigravity for code changes** — confirmed again
- **Nano Banana > Antigravity for illustrations** — dramatically better quality
- **Secret 6th tier deferred** — ship first, add as surprise update later
- **Don't rebrand Aria X for AgentHub** — create fresh @AgentHubXYZ later, keep Aria as supporter
- **Don't buy X accounts** — risky, VCs check authenticity. Grow organic.
- **Tweet voice idol: @mert (Mert)** — sharp observations, dark humor, sassy, trending takes, zero fluff. Benchmark for Gabe's shitposting style.

## AgentHub Build — Claude Code Overnight (Started ~8PM BRT)
- Prompt sent to Claude Code on Mac with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
- **Task 1 DONE:** Repo at github.com/gabchess/agenthub (couldn't create agenthub-xyz org, used gabchess)
  - Forked Antfarm core (3,765 LOC), rebranded package.json, added viem dependency
  - Initial commit: 86 files, 7,303 insertions
- **Task 2 DONE:** Monad integration layer
  - `src/chains/monad.ts` (409 lines): RPC connection, wallet abstraction, gas estimation, parallel tx via Promise.all(), local nonce tracking
  - `src/chains/types.ts` (105 lines): ChainId, WalletConfig, TransactionRequest, ParallelTxResult types
  - Build compiles clean, pushed to GitHub
- **Task 3 IN PROGRESS:** on_chain_verify step type added to types.ts, workflow-spec.ts validation mid-edit when session exported
- **Tasks 4-5 PENDING:** Monad health-check workflow + landing page
- Gabe told Claude Code to continue; left Mac running overnight
- **Gabe's new X banner:** Creation of Adam parody — human hand reaching toward lobster claw (OpenClaw). Bio: "building cool stuff w/ @arialinkwell"


## AgentHub Landing Page DEPLOYED (Late Night)
