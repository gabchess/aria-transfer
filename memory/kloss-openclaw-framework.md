# Kloss OpenClaw Framework — 8 Prompts for Optimization
Source: https://x.com/kloss_xyz/status/2020738433724137694

## The 8 Components
1. **Brain** — Maps the human (identity, operations, people, resources, friction, goals, cognition)
2. **Muscles** — Routes AI models (which model for what, subscriptions, cost, tiering)
3. **Bones** — Ingests codebases (repo inventory, architecture, conventions, dependencies)
4. **DNA** — Behavioral protocols (decision-making, risk tolerance, security, autonomy levels)
5. **Soul** — Personality (already have SOUL.md)
6. **Eyes** — Activation triggers (when to proactively act vs wait)
7. **Heartbeat** — Evolution/learning (periodic checks, self-improvement)
8. **Nerves** — Context efficiency (memory management, token budgets, what to load when)

## Implementation Status — ALL COMPLETE ✅
- [x] Soul (SOUL.md) — Personality & identity
- [x] Brain (USER.md) — Full human map: identity, operations, people, resources, friction, goals, cognition
- [x] Muscles (MUSCLES.md) — Model routing: 4 tiers, cost awareness, routing table, subscriptions
- [x] Bones (BONES.md) — Codebase map: 5 repos, stack/conventions/key files documented
- [x] DNA (DNA.md) — Behavioral protocols: decision-making, autonomy levels, risk tolerance, communication
- [x] Eyes (EYES.md) — Activation triggers: urgent/important/opportunistic/silent rules, push-back triggers
- [x] Heartbeat (HEARTBEAT.md) — Improved: mission board + sub-agents + EYES triggers + weekly maintenance
- [x] Nerves (NERVES.md) — Context efficiency: memory architecture, size limits, token budgets, recovery protocol

Implemented: Feb 9, 2026
