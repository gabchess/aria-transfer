# 2026-02-01 Research — Gabe's Deep Dive Assignment

## Sources Analyzed
1. YouTube: "How to make ClawdBot 10x better (5 easy steps)" (title only, couldn't get transcript)
2. Medium: "Claude Code team revealed their setup" (paywalled, got summary)
3. Gabe's X profile: 20 recent tweets/RTs
4. Gabe's Vibecoding Best Practices article (FULL read)
5. Daniel Miessler: Security issues with OpenClaw
6. Brandon Veiseh: PSA about exposed instances (1000+ on Shodan)
7. ClawdBot: 10-tweet security hardening thread
8. Simon Kim: Prompt Guard (349 attack patterns)
9. ClawHub: prompt-guard and dont-hack-me skills
10. Supermemory: Enhanced memory plugin (paid)
11. Brave Search API: Independent search for AI apps
12. Kimi K2.5: Cheap powerful model alternative
13. Goncalo's prompt: Security + memory + cost optimization setup

## Key Takeaways

### Security (CRITICAL)
- OpenClaw exposes port 18789 with no auth by default
- Shodan shows 1000+ vulnerable instances
- Must: bind to loopback, add auth tokens, redact sensitive data
- Prompt Guard: 349 attack patterns against injection, exfiltration
- File permissions: chmod 700 ~/.openclaw, 600 on config/auth
- Never expose Gateway publicly
- Use dedicated bot accounts for services
- Browser tasks in isolated profiles

### Vibecoding / Claude Code Optimization
- Context is king: AGENTS.md under 2.5k tokens
- Define → Plan → Review → Approve → Verify workflow
- Atomic tasks with binary success criteria
- Ralph Wiggum technique: autonomous loops, fresh context each iteration
- Parallel sessions (5+ for power users)
- Git worktrees for parallel feature development
- Opus 4.5 with thinking mode for complex decisions
- Verification-led development

### Cost Optimization
- qmd-skill: Claims 95% API cost reduction (needs verification)
- Kimi K2.5: 1T MoE model, 8-12x cheaper than Opus 4.5
- Ralph technique: $30 for ~10 iterations vs $400-600/day developer

### Memory Enhancement
- Supermemory: Cloud-based memory plugin, auto-recall/capture
- Requires Supermemory Pro subscription (paid)
- Alternative: We already have MEMORY.md + memory/*.md system

### Brave Search API
- Independent search index (not Google/Bing)
- Free tier available
- Could improve my web search capabilities
