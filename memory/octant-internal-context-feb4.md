# Octant Internal Context — Feb 4, 2026
*From team meeting notes shared by Gabe. CONFIDENTIAL — not for public posts.*

## EthDenver Presence (Feb 17-21)
- **Ben speaking** Friday at Public Goods Summit (likely Feb 14 side event or Feb 21 main event)
- **Live-stream: Feb 19** (morning, Denver time) — Mashal & Nico hosting, focused on vault migration rollout
- **Institutional dinner** planned with Funding Coordination Team & Framework Labs
- **Side events:** Privacy salon, walkiesETH Boulder
- **$5k dodgeball sponsorship DECLINED** — focus on migration outreach
- Coordination with Eugene for coherent content across events

## Vault Migration (MAJOR — happening NOW)
- Migration docs ready (auto, manual, sub-layers) + Spanish translation
- Email blast to users sent ~Feb 3
- Live-stream Feb 19 to support rollout and answer migration questions
- **MetaMask issue:** Batched transactions trigger "risky" warning — Andre investigating whitelisting/fix
- Follow-up videos/tutorials planned

## Vault UI Updates
- New vault UI already live
- Quentin recording demo videos + writing docs — delivery target Feb 7
- Vault update launch next week after materials ready
- Sync with Sarah on launch timing

## Project Atlas
- Docs on test site, link in #docs channel
- Tutorial video needed
- Onboarding emails to projects follow go-live
- Payment-splitter explainer (Ben & Quentin) to be produced

## LinkedIn Strategy
- Increased posting frequency → early signs of higher reach
- Marta tracking performance, will share findings in coming weeks
- Team encouraged to boost via personal accounts

## Support.eth Initiative (🔒 NOT PUBLIC YET)
- Major initiative with Ethereum Foundation, Protocol Guild, partners
- **Narrative:** "100% uptime for 100 years" — sustainable Ethereum infrastructure funding
- **Legal:** Lexer evaluation ongoing (AML/KYC concerns); alternative = separate multi-sig
- **Strategy shift:** Delay full public announcement until legal finalized + more funding commitments
- Treat launch like fundraise — secure commitments/logos first, then announce
- **Private dinner series** planned: Denver, NY, London, Singapore (TradFi/institutional)
- **DeFi Curator opportunity:** Leverage curator competition for public-goods-aligned vault strategies
- **Speaking:** Can discuss problem space generically, NOT specific fund structure/governance
- **Potential announcement:** EthCC or later for full public launch
