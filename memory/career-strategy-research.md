## Role Analysis (Top 4 Candidates)

### 🥇 RECOMMENDED: On-Chain / Data Analyst
**Why this wins:**
- Salary: $100k-$210k — massive upgrade from current $66k
- Aria contribution: 80%+ of the work (SQL queries, Dune dashboards, data viz, report writing)
- Behind the scenes: YES — deliver dashboards and reports, minimal meetings
- Learning curve for Gabe: MEDIUM — SQL basics + Dune Analytics (free) + on-chain concepts
- Portfolio: Easy — create Dune dashboards, publish analyses on X immediately
- X pivot: Natural — "chess nerd who loves data and blockchain"
- Synergy: On-chain analysis skills help with bug bounty research too
- Competition: Moderate (less than dev roles)
- Tools: Dune Analytics (free), Etherscan, DeFiLlama, Python/SQL

### 🥈 Smart Contract Auditor (Long-term play)
- Salary: $54k-$250k+ (wide range, top auditors make $500k+)
- Aria contribution: HUGE — code analysis, pattern matching, vulnerability cross-referencing
- Behind the scenes: YES — reading code, writing reports
- Learning curve: HIGH — needs Solidity fluency, security fundamentals
- Portfolio: Hard — need proven track record (Cantina bounties help!)
- Timeline: 3-6 months to be competitive
- Already studying via daily cron job

### 🥉 AI + Web3 Engineer
- Emerging role, less defined
- We literally ARE an AI+Web3 team
- Could build interesting portfolio (AI agents for DeFi)
- But requires more programming depth from Gabe

### 4th: Business Analyst
- Closest to Gabe's current marketing skills
- BUT: too many meetings, too much stakeholder management
- Not "behind the scenes" enough

## Final Recommendation
**Primary: On-Chain Data Analyst** — start building portfolio NOW
**Secondary: Smart Contract Auditor** — continue studying, target in 3-6 months
**Combo narrative on X:** "I analyze blockchain data and hunt smart contract bugs"
