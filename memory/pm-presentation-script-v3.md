# Mashal 1-on-1 Script v3 — Full Walkthrough

**Vibe:** Not an audition. You got the role. This is alignment + showing you're already executing.

## OPENING (30 seconds)

"Hey Mashal, loved what you shared with the team today. I'm really excited about this role. I want to walk you through what I've already been working on, and then show you my board with everything I'm proposing and tracking."

## PART 1: MIRO COMPETITIVE RESEARCH (7-10 min)

Link: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVGDqJIG4=/

### FRAME 1 — Title + Methodology

"So I looked at 9 DeFi protocols and how they communicate their value compared to us. Yearn, Aave, Morpho, Ether.fi, EigenLayer, Sky, Pendle, Ethena, and Lido. I went through every homepage, read their docs, analyzed their X accounts, and compared their messaging side by side with ours. Here's what I found."

### FRAME 2 — Market Positioning Map

"This is the big picture. I mapped every protocol on two axes: are they focused on individual yield or ecosystem growth? And are they consumer-facing or infrastructure?

Look at the bottom-left. That's where everyone is fighting. Morpho, Lido, Yearn, Aave. All infrastructure, all optimizing yield for the individual. It's crowded.

Top-left, you've got Ether.fi, Pendle, Ethena. Consumer products, still individual yield. Top-right, Sky and Gitcoin. Consumer-facing, some ecosystem angle.

And then bottom-right... just us. Octant is the only protocol building infrastructure where yield funds ecosystem growth. Nobody else is doing this. That's a massive positioning advantage, but we're not communicating it clearly enough. Which brings me to..."

### FRAME 3 — Messaging Comparison

"I compared how each protocol opens their homepage. Everyone leads with a clear value prop. Aave says 'The protocol to borrow and earn interest.' Lido says 'Liquid staking for digital tokens.' Pendle does 'The yield trading protocol.'

Every single one tells you what they do in one sentence. Our homepage... doesn't do that yet. We have great content deeper in, but the first impression needs work. The good news is, the fix is simple."

### FRAME 4 — Key Findings

"Three big takeaways:

One, every competitor leads with a number. Aave shows TVL. Lido shows ETH staked. Pendle shows volume. Numbers build instant credibility. We should lead with our impact number, like total ETH distributed to public goods.

Two, we're underselling our uniqueness. No one else turns staking yield into ecosystem growth. That should be the first thing people read.

Three, our design holds up well. The branding is clean and modern. It's really the messaging hierarchy that needs the update."

### FRAME 5 — Design & Branding

"I also looked at the visual side. Here are full-page screenshots of our homepage next to Morpho, Aave, and Lido. Notice the pattern.

Morpho: dark, clean, sans-serif, numbers front and center. Aave: light, minimal, professional fintech look. Lido: clean with a prominent security section.

Now look at ours. We use decorative serif typography, the fantasy and RPG narrative elements, heavy orange palette. It's creative and unique, but there's a tension. We're selling 'Institutional-Grade Vaults' with branding that feels more indie or playful.

This isn't a 'change everything' recommendation. But it's worth asking: does our visual language match what we're actually building? Morpho's dark, clean look communicates trust instantly. When institutions or DAOs land on our page, what's their first impression?"

🔸 If Mashal asks: "Are you saying the branding is bad?"
→ "Not bad. Distinctive. The question is whether distinctive is working for or against us when we're trying to attract institutional depositors. For a consumer product, playful works. For institutional infrastructure, it might create friction."

🔸 If she asks: "The dragon narrative was intentional"
→ "Totally. And internally it works great for culture and storytelling. The question is just whether external-facing pages should lean more toward the clean, trust-building patterns that every competitor uses. The brand can stay fun in content and community while the product pages go cleaner."

### FRAME 6 — Recommendations

"Five actionable recommendations.

One: lead the homepage with a real number. '$X million in yield redirected to grow Ethereum.' Whatever our strongest metric is right now. Every competitor does this because it works.

Two: make our partner logos bigger and brighter. And consider adding ecosystem quotes. Something like 'Protocol Guild used Octant yield to fund 180+ Ethereum contributors.' Real impact stories.

Three: add a security section. Audit badges, bug bounty link, trust signals. Table stakes in DeFi.

Four: consider headline alternatives that capture our unique position. 'Earn for yourself. Build for everyone.' 'Your yield grows Ethereum.' 'Infrastructure that gives back.'

Five: evaluate whether the RPG branding matches the institutional positioning, and consider a cleaner visual direction for v2's external pages.

That's it. Happy to dig deeper into any of these."

🔸 If Mashal asks: "What's the priority?"
→ "The homepage stat. Fastest to implement, biggest impact. Just pick our strongest number and make it huge. Everything else can follow."

🔸 If she asks: "Can you implement any of these?"
→ "The messaging and copy suggestions, absolutely. The design changes would need the design team. But I can write the copy for any new sections today."

**Landing line:** "This is the kind of research I'll be producing on a regular basis. Monthly competitive reports, landscape changes, new players entering our space. Aligns exactly with what you described today about understanding what's happening across all fronts."

## PART 2: NOTION MISSION CONTROL (5-7 min)

"Now let me show you how I'm tracking everything. I built this board to keep things organized and transparent."

### Done column:
- **X Automated Competitor Tracking System** — "Already built an automated system that tracks competitor activity on X. Runs daily."
- **Unfollow accounts not following us back** — "Quick cleanup, done."

### In Progress column:
- **Competitive Research Feb '26** — "What I just showed you on Miro."
- **StreamYard Video Organization** — "Working on getting those videos organized for Proton Drive."
- **Dev Meeting Notes Template** — "Now that I'm bridging tech and marketing, I'll produce a summary after every dev call. Key decisions, action items, and what marketing needs to know."
- **V1→V2 Migration Resource Hub** — "I already looked at the v2 docs and the migration page. Epoch 11 opens Feb 18, migration is 3 on-chain transactions, time-weighted rewards mean early movers benefit. I'm building the Notion hub with all the links, FAQ, and space for Nico's tutorial videos when they're ready. Quick question: what's the full scope? Just the migration flow, or also the onboarding docs for new capital providers?"

### Proposed column (show the pipeline):
- **n8n + AI Automation Layer** [HIGH] — "This is the big one. n8n is a free, open-source workflow automation tool. I can set up a competitor monitoring workflow that auto-tracks when Aave, Morpho, Lido post updates and sends us a summary. Zero cost, visual, secure. We can have the first one running this week."
- **Multi-Agent AI Workflows** [HIGH] — "For bigger tasks like automated content pipelines. Research, outline, draft, edit, review. A team of AI agents managed by one command."
- **AI Content Repurposer** [HIGH] — "Takes our existing content and adapts it for different platforms."
- **AI Meeting Notes → Action Items Pipeline** — "Ties into the dev bridge role. Automated summaries after every meeting."
- **Octant KPI Dashboard (Dune)** [MEDIUM] — "Similar to what Q showed with the donor dashboard. I can build Dune dashboards tracking our ecosystem metrics."
- **Website Analytics Setup** [MEDIUM] — "I heard the team is setting up Matomo. I can help define what we track and build conversion funnels."
- **User Feedback Collection System** [MEDIUM] — "Connects to what Borderless said about needing distribution. A system to collect and categorize community feedback."
- **Monthly Competitive Reports** [LOW] — "Recurring version of what I just showed you."
- **Sprint Cycles Proposal** [LOW] — "Bringing structure to how we plan and ship."

## PART 3: CONNECTING TO TODAY'S MEETING (2-3 min)

"Based on what you shared today, here's how I see my priorities:"

1. **Tech bridge:** "I'll start attending dev calls this week. After each one, marketing gets a summary with what's shipping and what we need to communicate."

2. **Migration Resource Hub:** "Already started. I'll have it ready before Feb 18."

3. **AI Prompt Library pickup:** "I noticed there's an AI Prompt Library initiative that Quentin started. I can pick that up and take it further with the 25 specialized marketing skills I've already set up. Instead of just a prompt library, we'd have actual automated workflows."

4. **Research automation:** "The n8n setup I proposed can automate a lot of the competitive monitoring. Instead of me manually checking, we get alerts when something changes."

---

## PART 4: ASK FOR INPUT (1 min)

"What's your take? Anything you'd want me to prioritize differently?"

---

## POWER PHRASES
- "I already started on that"
- "Here's what I found"
- "We can have this running this week"
- "Zero cost, open source"
- "I'll produce a summary after every dev call"
- "What would you prioritize?"
- "This aligns with what you described today"

## AVOID
- "Great question!" (AI tell)
- Being defensive if she pushes back
- Over-explaining AI tools (keep it practical, not technical)
- Saying "Atlas" (unclear what this refers to)
- Bullshitting — "Let me look into that" is always fine

## IF SHE ASKS:
- **"What's the cost?"** → "n8n is free, open source. AI tools run on existing budgets. The only cost is my time."
- **"Can you demo this?"** → "I can set up the first workflow today and show you results tomorrow."
- **"What about the migration timeline?"** → "Epoch 11 allocation window opens Feb 18. I'll have the resource hub ready before that. The v2 docs are already live at docs.v2.octant.build."
- **"How do you prioritize?"** → "High-impact items first. The competitive research and n8n automation give us the most value fastest."
- **"What about Quentin's AI Prompt Library?"** → "I saw it's been in production stage since July but hasn't started yet. I can build on that foundation and extend it from static prompts into automated workflows that actually run."

## GENERAL TIPS

- Keep it conversational. You're walking her through your work, not reading slides.
- Pause after each frame. Let her react. Let her ask questions.
- If she pushes back: "That's fair. What's your take?" works every time.
- If you don't know an answer: "Good question. Let me look into that and get back to you." Never bullshit.
- End with: "The biggest takeaway is that we have a positioning advantage nobody else has. We just need to communicate it better. I'm happy to start working on any of these recommendations this week."

You got this, Gabe. 💪🔥
