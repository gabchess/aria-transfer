## 📝 NOTES

- "Web3 engineer" is dead. Specialize in: data, security, or AI.
- Depth > breadth in 2026
- Remote roles are common
- Direct applications work better than LinkedIn for data roles
- Show shipped work, not just credentials

### Geographic Bias Reality
- Many roles say "US East Coast or Europe only" (see Dune PMM role)
- Third world applicants face invisible filters
- **Gabe's strategy:** Put Portugal in LinkedIn location
- Apply via X DMs / Telegram / direct email, not just LinkedIn

### Creative Portfolio Ideas
- **"Wrapped" style dashboards** — Do these EOY when Spotify Wrapped trends
- All brands do year-end recaps = viral potential
- Ideas: "Octant Wrapped", "Base Wrapped", "Your Wallet Wrapped"
- For NOW (Feb): Find other creative data viz concepts that trend earlier in year

*Review with Gabe in evening session. Prioritize Dune application after dashboard is built.*
