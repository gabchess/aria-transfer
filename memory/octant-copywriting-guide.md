# Octant Copywriting Guide (from file_2)

## Core Formula
**Good copy = Emotional truth + Specific evidence + Clear action**
**Bad copy = Buzzwords + Generic flattery + Vague promise**

## The Anti-AI-Slop Checklist

### BANNED Vocabulary
meticulous, game changer, landscape, delved, revolutionize, empowers, seamlessly, thrilled, imagine, transforming, "dive in", "picture this", "of the utmost importance", "crucial to note", "It's all about", "Here's the deal", "Let's talk about", Alright, wild, folks, "Here's the kicker", "at the end of the day", essential, vital, crucial

### Pattern Bans
1. "Not Just X, It's Y" → ✅ "We're building X. Period."
2. Em-Dash Overuse → ✅ Use periods. Short sentences.
3. Rule of Three → ✅ "Quality first, then speed, then scalability."
4. Chatbot Artifacts → ✅ Direct to the point.
5. Sycophantic Flattery → ✅ "Good question. Here's the answer."
6. Filler Phrases → ✅ "To" not "In order to", "Because" not "Due to the fact that"
7. Generic Conclusions → ✅ "Here's what we're building."

## Mashal's Three H's Framework
- **Heart:** Show up as a real person. Struggles, wins, learning moments.
- **Heat:** Strong opinions & personal stakes. Bold stances.
- **Head:** Trusted curator & synthesizer. "Here's what this means for YOU."

## Message Architecture Patterns

### Pattern 1: Emotional Hook → Specific Detail → Universal Truth → CTA
### Pattern 2: Show the Work → Acknowledge Difficulty → Build Trust
### Pattern 3: Problem → Our Solution → Social Proof → CTA

## Copywriting Funnel
1. **Headline:** Pain/emotion, fragments, specific, curiosity
2. **Opening:** Start with reader's experience, not yours
3. **Value Proposition:** Universal truth → Specific metric → Context
4. **Proof:** Numbers build trust faster than adjectives
5. **CTA:** Connect to reader's benefit or mission
