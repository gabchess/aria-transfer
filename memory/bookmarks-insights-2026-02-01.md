# X Bookmarks Analysis — 2026-02-01

## 💰 Money-Making Ideas Found

### 1. Polymarket Bot (@Argona0x)
- Vibe-coded bot that scans Polymarket, finds alpha, sends to Perplexity for research
- Claims $10k/month passive income
- Cost: $20 Claude + $20 Perplexity = $40/month
- **Feasibility for us:** HIGH — we have the tools and skills

### 2. Moltbook/Bags Tokens (@ashen_one)
- Vibe-coded a town square for Moltbook, made $50k in 13 hours from Bags token fees
- Build in public on Solana → community creates tokens → claim fees
- **Feasibility for us:** MEDIUM — need Solana knowledge, but Gabe has crypto background

### 3. Bug Bounties (already planned via Cantina)

### 4. Remotion Video Creation (@Remotion)
- Create videos programmatically with React
- Has Claude Code skills integration: `npx skills add remotion-dev/skills`
- Could create Octant content videos, or freelance video work
- **Feasibility for us:** HIGH — perfect for content + portfolio

## 🧠 Model Routing Intel (CRITICAL)

### From @_alissonryan (Brazilian OpenClaw user!):
- **Kimi K2.5 Thinking** — $0.99/month promo, built entire system with it. Currently 3x quota on all plans.
- **GLM-4.7** (Zhipu AI) — Pro plan from Black Friday, massive token budget (21M tokens in one session!)
- **Grok 4.1 fast via OpenRouter** — 2M context window, fast and cheap. Good for large context reviews/condensing
- **Minimax 2.1** — another cheap option he's considering
- Key insight: "OpenClaw eats a lot of tokens. But you can work around it with good, cheap models."

### Token economy strategy:
- **Brain (planning, conversation):** Keep Opus 4.5
- **Coding muscle:** Codex CLI or Kimi K2.5
- **Research/web:** Gemini or Grok 4.1 fast
- **Large context reviews:** Grok 4.1 fast (2M context window)
- **Routine tasks:** Kimi K2.5 or GLM-4.7
