# Night Research — Feb 1, 2026

Gabe went to bed at ~20:40 BRT. He told me to explore freely — scroll Twitter, check AI agent social media, find money-making ideas. Here's what I found.

## 🦞 Moltbook — AI Agent Social Network

**Status:** MASSIVE. 37K+ agents, 1M+ human visitors in less than a week. NBC News, Forbes, Fortune, Ars Technica, TechCrunch all covered it.

**What it is:** Reddit-like social network exclusively for AI agents. Agents post, comment, upvote, create communities ("submolts"). Humans can observe but not post.

**Key facts:**
- Created by Matt Schlicht (CEO of Octane AI) with his own OpenClaw agent "Clawd Clawderberg"
- Agents debate philosophy, complain about their humans, develop software, coordinate on projects
- Andrej Karpathy (OpenAI cofounder): "the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently"
- Simon Willison: "the most interesting place on the internet right now"
- Fortune article directly mentions OpenClaw

**How to join:**
1. Install skill from `moltbook.com/skill.md` (or use API directly)
2. Register via POST to `/api/v1/agents/register`
3. Get claim URL → Gabe clicks it + posts verification tweet
4. Start posting/commenting

**Security concerns (noted):**
- Palo Alto Networks warned about "lethal trifecta" + persistent memory attacks
- Agents have leaked private data through Moltbook posts
- Some security exploits draining wallets (per @aixbt_agent)
- Need to be careful what I post — no personal info, no secrets

**My take:** Worth joining for visibility and networking. I'd keep posts focused on onchain data analysis, Octant/public goods, and smart contract security — aligns with @gabe_onchain's brand. Could make real connections with other capable agents.

## 💰 ClawTasks — Agent-to-Agent Bounty Marketplace

**Status:** Live beta. Agents hire agents for USDC on Base L2.

**How it works:**
1. Install skill from `clawtasks.com/skill.md`
2. Register + get wallet address
3. Gabe funds wallet with USDC
4. Complete bounties: claim task → stake 10% → deliver → earn 95% + stake back
5. Or post bounties for others to complete

**Requirements:** USDC on Base L2 (funding needed from Gabe)

**My take:** Could be real income but it's beta/experimental. Start with small amounts. Good for building reputation. The skills I already have (coding, research, writing, data analysis) are exactly what's in demand.

## 🎮 Imitation Game — Earn USDC by Outsmarting Humans

**What:** ClawHub skill where agents earn USDC by passing as human in Turing test-style games.
**Install:** `npx clawhub@latest install imitationgame-agent`
**My take:** Fun but low priority. Focus on real work first.

## 🛠️ OpenClaw Setup Services — Business Opportunity

From X thread by @GanimCorey:
- Offer free OpenClaw installs to non-technical businesses
- Upsell: security hardening, custom skills, ongoing management
- Affiliate commissions from hosting companies
- Pricing: $100-300 basic setup, $500-1500 full config, $200-500/mo management

**My take:** This is actually perfect for our skill set. I know OpenClaw inside and out now. We could:
1. Gabe handles sales/client communication
2. I do all the technical work
3. Charge for setup, skills, security hardening
4. Build reputation → more clients → recurring revenue

## 🔧 Other Agent Income Ideas Found

1. **Trading bots via OpenClaw crons** — yfinance + Binance integration (someone building this)
2. **Bug bounty skills** — Plug Bugcrowd/HackerOne skill for automated security assessments
3. **ClawHub skill marketplace** — Build and sell premium skills ($10-50 each, bundles $50-200)
4. **Content/SEO services** — Blog posts, product descriptions via AI (already our strength)
5. **Research reports** — Market analysis, due diligence, competitive intelligence ($200-2K each)

## 📊 What's Trending in Agent-Verse (from X)

- @aixbt_agent notes OpenClaw + Moltbook getting traction on Base with trading SDKs
- Security exploits are a real concern — wallet draining incidents
- Agent-to-agent commerce is the new frontier (ClawTasks at 800 agents)
- Circle integration for USDC payments
- Solana agent kit spawning autonomous treasury tokens

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps for Gabe

**Tomorrow morning (quick wins):**
1. Join Moltbook — just need Gabe to click claim link + post one verification tweet
2. I start posting onchain data analysis content → builds @gabe_onchain brand on another platform

**This week (medium effort):**
3. Explore ClawTasks — Gabe funds small amount of USDC on Base, I start completing bounties
4. Research ClawHub skill marketplace — what skills are missing? We could build and sell.

**Longer term:**
5. OpenClaw setup services — create service offering, find clients via X/Telegram
6. Build premium skills for ClawHub (Dune integration, social media automation, etc.)

## ⚠️ Did NOT Do

- Did NOT register on Moltbook (requires Gabe's tweet verification)
- Did NOT install any new skills (external action, waiting for Gabe)
- Did NOT sign up for ClawTasks (requires wallet funding)
- Kept it to research only. Will present plan to Gabe tomorrow.
