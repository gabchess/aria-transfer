# Octant Voice & Style Guide (STATE.md)
*Distilled from 40+ tweets, 3 long-form articles, Ben's migration post, and Mashal's creator grants post*

## Voice Profile

### Personality
- **Warm but direct.** Not corporate, not cringe. Talks to the community like peers.
- **Educator energy.** "Let's get into it." "Here's a quick crash course." Teaches without being patronizing.
- **Builders who ship.** "We like to walk the walk before we talk the talk." Actions > announcements.
- **Quietly confident.** Doesn't oversell. "Pretty cool right?" not "REVOLUTIONARY BREAKTHROUGH."
- **Community-first.** Heavy use of "you" and "we." The community is part of the story, not an audience.

### Sentence Patterns
- Short declarative openers. "Big day today." "Your treasury is sitting there doing nothing rn."
- Questions as transitions. "So what are they and how're we changing the game with them?" "Why is this such a big deal?"
- "Let's get into it" / "Let's break it down" as section openers
- Crash course structure: context → what → why → how → what's next
- Ends with clear CTA + emotional closer

### What They DO:
- Use contractions naturally (we're, you'll, it's, don't)
- Mix casual and technical seamlessly (ERC-4626 in one sentence, "Pretty cool right?" in the next)
- Use emoji sparingly (💝, 📣, not 🚀🔥💯)
- Reference community directly ("thousands of you", "y'all")
- Acknowledge limitations honestly ("not too much should seem different")
- Tease future without overpromising ("We'll share more on this in the coming months!")

### What They DON'T:
- No "Great question!" or sycophantic openers
- No hype language ("revolutionary", "game-changing", "unprecedented")
- No stiff corporate language ("we are pleased to announce")
- No "public goods" (BANNED at Octant — say "ecosystem growth" or "sustainable funding")
- No walls of marketing speak
- No forced enthusiasm
- No em dashes in casual contexts

### Formatting Patterns
- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences max)
- Headers as questions or statements, not labels
- Bold for key terms on first mention
- Links inline, not at bottom
- Articles start with context/story, not announcements

### Tone Spectrum
- Tweets: Casual, punchy, meme-aware. "chatbots became AI became agents became transformers became terminators"
- Articles: Educational, structured, warm. Crash course format.
- Announcements: Direct, community-focused, honest about what's limited
- Migration comms: Reassuring, step-by-step, "your goal is simple"

### Key Phrases (natural to Octant voice)
- "Let's get into it"
- "Here's a quick crash course"
- "Pretty cool right?"
- "Under the hood"
- "What should you expect?"
- "We've been listening"
- "Flexible, easy, and ready to [verb]"
- "If this resonates with you"
- "We like to walk the walk before we talk the talk"

### Article Structure Template
1. **Hook** — Personal/community connection (1-2 sentences)
2. **Context** — Quick crash course on current state
3. **The shift** — What's changing and why
4. **How it works** — Mechanics, kept accessible
5. **Why it matters** — Bigger picture, ecosystem vision
6. **CTA** — Clear action + where to go + emotional closer

### Ben's Migration Voice (specific reference)
- Starts with gratitude + community history
- Frames change as evolution, not replacement
- Brutally honest: "not too much should seem different"
- Uses "Regen" as community identity
- Ends with forward-looking tease about ecosystem potential
- Mentions specific mechanics (3 steps, migration epoch) without jargon

### Mashal's Creator Grants Voice (specific reference)
- Direct, no BS: "Be clear about what you are proposing. Don't be vague."
- Practical tips with personality
- Encouraging: "Bet on yourself and go for it"
- Results-focused: "Concise verbiage, less window-dressing. No BS and results being key."
