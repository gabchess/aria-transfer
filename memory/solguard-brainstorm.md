# SolGuard Brainstorm\n\n## 1. Additional Ideas to Make SolGuard More Powerful and Differentiated\n\n* **Community Scoring/Wisdom of the Crowd:** Allow users to flag suspicious tokens & wallets, incorporate these flags into the risk score (with safeguards against abuse).\n* **Simulate Transactions:** BEFORE alerting, simulate a small buy/sell of the token to detect honeypots. This adds a layer of certainty.\n* **Integrate Sentiment Analysis:** Scrape Twitter/X, Discord, and Telegram for sentiment data related to the token. Negative sentiment can be a red flag.\n* **Gamified Alerts:** Turn scam detection into a game. Users earn points for accurate scam predictions, leaderboard, etc.\n* **SolGuard Score API:** Offer a paid API for other platforms/wallets to integrate SolGuard's risk scores.\n* **Auto-Revoke Permissions:** For users who connect their wallets to SolGuard, offer a feature to automatically revoke permissions from risky contracts.\n* **Cross-Chain Analysis:** Track deployer/funder wallets on Ethereum, BSC, etc. for cross-chain rug pulls.\n* **Early LP Detection:** Focus exclusively on detecting pre-launch/early LP before RugCheck or others. Be the absolute FIRST detector.\n* **Burn Detection:** Detect tokens that have had large amounts burned by the deployer to artificially inflate price. Signals are: Deployer burning tokens + aggressive marketing.\n\n## 2. Risk Signals to Detect (Beyond LP Locked, Mint Authority)\n\n* **LP Unlock Timeline:** Check HOW LONG LP is locked. Shorter lock = higher risk.\n* **Hidden Mint Authority:** Detect sneaky ways to mint tokens even without \"mint authority\".\n* **Whale Concentration:** Gini coefficient of token holders. Very high concentration = potential for whale dump.\n* **Proxy Contract Detection:** If the token is deployed via a proxy contract, that adds complexity and potential risk.\n* **Suspicious Function Calls:** Monitor function calls to the token contract. Unusual calls (e.g., self-destruct, batch transfers to few wallets) are red flags.\n* **Dusting Attack Detection:** Small amounts sent to many wallets to make them seem legitimate (increase holder count).\n* **Sudden LP Removal Warning:** If a large amount of LP is removed, give users an early warning.\n* **Honeypot Simulation:** Try to sell a very small amount. If selling is blocked but buying works it is a honeypot and should be flagged as red.\n\n## 3. Dashboard Design\n\n* **Data:**\n    * Token Name/Symbol\n    * SolGuard Risk Score (0-100, color-coded RED/YELLOW/GREEN)\n    * Liquidity Pool Size\n    * Deployer Wallet Age\n    * Number of Holders\n    * Social Sentiment Score (positive/negative/neutral)\n    * Last Transaction Time\n    * Top Holders (with percentages)\n    * LP Lock Info (time remaining)\n    * Audit Status (if any)\n    * Wallet graph - funding flow & prior rugs\n* **Layout:**\n    * Table format with sortable columns.\n    * Filters: Risk score range, liquidity, deployer age, etc.\n    * Token search bar.\n    * \"Trending tokens\" section (newest/highest volume).\n    * Token detail popup: Expand to show more info (wallet graph, social sentiment analysis, contract analysis).\n* **Shareability/Viral:**\n    * Clear visual risk indicators (flashing red for high risk).\n    * \"Share\" button to easily post token risk score on X/Twitter with pre-filled message.\n    * Embeddable widget for websites/wallets.\n    * Leaderboard of \"safest\" and \"riskiest\" tokens.\n\n## 4. Tweet Alert Format\n\n* **Maximizes Impact:**\n    * **\[SolGuard Alert]** HIGH RISK: \[Token Name] (\[$TICKER])\n    * Risk Score: \[Score]/100 (Color-coded indicator)\n    * \[Reason 1: e.g. Deployer funded by known rugger]\n    * \[Reason 2: e.g. LP unlock in 24 hours]\n    * View details & wallet graph: \[SolGuard Dashboard Link]\n    * (NO hashtags — per our voice guide, never use hashtags)\n    * Image: Screenshot of the token's risk details from the dashboard.\n* **Screenshot Format:**\n    * Clean, clear layout.\n    * Highlight the risk score prominently.\n    * Show key risk factors (e.g., deployer history).\n    * Include SolGuard logo/branding.\n\n## 5. Wallet Graph Techniques\n\n* **Beyond Fund Flow:**\n    * **Code Similarity:** If multiple tokens are deployed with NEARLY identical code, link the deployers.\n    * **Shared Infrastructure:** Track deployers who use the same RPC endpoints, hosting, or other infrastructure.\n    * **Multisig Connections:** If multiple deployers are controlled by the SAME multisig wallet, link them.\n    * **Social Connections:** Track deployer wallets that follow each other on Twitter/X or are in the same Telegram groups.\n    * **NFT Ownership Links:** Link wallets that own NFTs from the same suspicious collections.\n\n## 6. Other Data Sources and APIs to Integrate\n\n* **SolanaFM:** Comprehensive Solana data API. Could be an alternative to Helius.\n* **Chainlink Price Feeds:** Get reliable price data for tokens.\n* **CoinGecko/CoinMarketCap:** Token price, volume, and market cap data.\n* **LunarCrush:** Social media metrics for crypto projects.\n* **Nansen:** On-chain analytics and wallet labels.\n* **BlockVision:** Web3 Data Platform.\n\n## 7. How Sophisticated Ruggers Try to Evade Detection - And How to Counter Each Evasion\n\n* **Evasion:** Deploying tokens through multiple layers of wallets to obfuscate the origin of funds.\n    * **Counter:** Increase the depth of fund flow tracing. Use heuristics to identify \"money laundering\" patterns.\n* **Evasion:** Using proxy contracts to hide malicious code.\n    * **Counter:** Analyze the proxy contract itself. Identify the underlying implementation contract and analyze it thoroughly.\n* **Evasion:** Slowly draining liquidity over time instead of a sudden rug pull.\n    * **Counter:** Track LP removal trends over time. Set alerts for unusual decreases in liquidity.\n* **Evasion:** Deploying with seemingly safe parameters (LP locked, mint authority revoked) THEN exploiting hidden vulnerabilities.\n    * **Counter:** Continuous contract monitoring. Simulate execution of various contract functions to identify exploits.\n* **Evasion:** Using flash loans to manipulate token prices or liquidity.\n    * **Counter:** Monitor flash loan usage patterns. Identify unusual spikes in flash loan activity related to a specific token.\n\n## 8.
