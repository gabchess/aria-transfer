# X/Twitter Algorithm Breakdown (Feb 2, 2026)

Source: Newsletter shared by Gabe — analysis of Twitter algorithm code + articles

## Core Shift
Twitter is no longer ranking posts → it's **predicting user behavior**
- Predicts: likes, replies, reposts, clicks, dwell time, profile visits, follows
- Also predicts NEGATIVE actions: not interested, mute, block, report
- Combined into a single score per post per user

## Key Principles

### 1. Any Engagement Is NOT Good Engagement
- Replies that lead to mutes/blocks train algo to suppress you
- Rage bait = dangerous long-term (replies + negative signals = net negative)
- "Noisy engagement" from wrong audience hurts distribution

### 2. Discovery Is Similarity-Based, Not Popularity-Based
- Algo surfaces posts resembling patterns users already engage with
- Niche consistency = algorithmic advantage
- Jumping topics increases uncertainty → reduces distribution
- "Boring in the same way every day" = growth signal

### 3. No Protected Lane for Followers
- Following someone ≠ guaranteed visibility
- All posts (follow + non-follow) scored in same system
- Smaller accounts CAN break through if engagement signals are right

### 4. Formats Don't Rank, Behaviors Do
- No special boost for threads, videos, images, hashtags
- Formats only matter through the behavior they trigger
- Better question: "What action should this post trigger?"

### 5. Overposting Works Against You
- Diversity mechanism: algo won't show same author too often
- Volume ≠ opportunity; reposting same idea = fewer chances
- Fewer strong posts > higher volume of average ones

### 6. Follow Prediction = Strongest Positive Signal
- "Would someone follow you after reading this post?"
- Design posts with this question in mind

## Action Items
1. Design each post for ONE primary action (reply, repost, follow, or dwell)
2. Write for a specific audience every time (not "everyone interested in X")
3. Reduce noisy engagement — avoid attracting people who'll never follow
4. Post less, be more impactful per post
5. Each post = training data. Reduce uncertainty about who your content is for.

## Mental Model
> "Each post is training data — you're either reducing uncertainty about who your content is for or increasing it."

The system rewards:
- Consistent niche posting
- Attracting people who stick around
- Predictable content patterns the algo can confidently distribute

The system punishes:
- Topic jumping
- Format chasing without strategy
- Engagement from wrong audiences
- Confusing content that causes permanent disengagement
