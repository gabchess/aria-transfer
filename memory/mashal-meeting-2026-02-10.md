- **Nico** → Partnerships & Relationship Building (capital onboarding for funding experiments)
- **Gabe** → Product-Market Bridge Role:
  - Interfacing with tech team as bridge between product/tech and marketing

  - Automating research workflows
  - AI agent experiments (Mashal said: "for any and all AI questions, go to Gabe")
- **Mashal** → Handling Twitter/X personally

### 2. Boys Club Media Partnership (3 months)
- Octant is main sponsor for live streams this season
- Anchorage is co-sponsor (institutional capital = good positioning)
- First event: Tomorrow - Artem + Arnhem on voice club live stream (10-12 min slot)
- Focus: Artem's vision for the year, starting with vaults
- They'll feature: migration launch, any rounds, newsletter mentions
- First media partnership ever for Octant

### 3. Artem's Vision Post (Tomorrow)
- Artem publishing vision + intro to "Octant Labs"
- Strategy: Publish from Artem's personal account (not Octant channels) for profile building
- Team amplifies on socials, quote tweet, engage
- Sets the tone: "this is a person that's leading us"

### 4. Creator Flow Revised
- Need a form where creators submit ideas + pricing (standardization)
- Mashal creates groups with Sarah + Nico + creator
- **Nico reviews content for accuracy** (scaling: Mashal no longer sole bottleneck)
- **Gabe's task:** Be available for technical accuracy review too

### 5. Events
- **Denver dinner** - Intimate, invite-only institutional dinner. Gabe lives there? (transcription may be confused - Gabe is in Rio)
- **Korea dinner** - Co-hosting with Fiddle Asia after ECC. Nico + Mashal + potentially Artem. First venture into Korea.

### 6. Migration / Atlas
- Atlas deploying Friday or Monday
- Documentation already on Tailscale (dev environment), going public Friday
- **Gabe's tasks:**
  - Create Notion document with all resources (Atlas guide links, videos, FAQ)
  - Support hand-holding for projects migrating
  - Create video tutorials (Loom) for common questions
  - Blog post: step-by-step with short 15-20 second video chunks
- **Nico** creating Atlas tutorial videos too
- Telegram support group for project questions
- Analytics: Matomo tracking from v1 → v2 website

### 7. Strategic Priorities (High Level)
- **Big goal:** Establish Octant as most credible voice on public goods, governance, experimentation, Ethereum
- Three goals:
  1. Own the narrative around Ethereum's future
  2. Build relationships that convert
  3. Operationalize partner support
- Transition from "unsung heroes" to "go-to voice" for Ethereum opinions
- By end of year: at least one revenue experiment, funded collaboration, partners
- Challenge: "How are we different, how do we stay top of mind?"
- Mashal emphasized: "outsourced decision making" = team should filter ideas before proposing

### 8. Team Meetings
- Need TWO meetings going forward: one big team meeting + one coordination meeting
- LinkedIn hours: weekly sessions where anyone can write/be active on LinkedIn

### 9. Donor Dashboard Demo (by another team member)
- "Donor Intelligence Console" - full-stack app with database, API endpoints
- Features: velocity, concentration, donor analysis, cohort analysis, project network graph
- Mashal: "I am so impressed. I have so many more questions"
- Next step: get real Octant data in, potentially ship as part of migration

### 10. Distribution Feedback
- Borderless project feedback: biggest need from Octant = DISTRIBUTION
- Projects don't know how to reach Octant community
- Marketing gets props for Twitter spaces but doesn't carry through at app level
- Potential: dashboard/portal for projects to communicate with Octant community
