## Miro Board Session (Morning)
- **Building PM Task 1 competitive analysis** with Gabe in Miro
- **Board name:** "Octant Competitive Analysis" (blank board, custom layout)
- **Template:** Started with Miro's official Competitive Analysis template but it was too basic (just Unique/Better/Same/Poor columns for one competitor). Switched to blank board.

### Frames built so far:
1. **Title frame** — "Competitive Messaging Analysis: DeFi Vault Protocols vs Octant" + subtitle + protocols listed. No "prepared by/for" (Gabe's call).
2. **Market Positioning Map (2x2)** — THE money slide
   - X-axis: Individual Yield Focus ↔ Ecosystem Growth Focus
   - Y-axis: Consumer-Facing ↔ Infra/B2B
   - Top-left (Consumer + Individual Yield): Ether.fi, Pendle, Ethena
   - Bottom-left (Infra + Individual Yield): Morpho, Lido, Yearn, Aave
   - Top-right (Consumer + Ecosystem Growth): Sky, Gitcoin
   - Bottom-right (Infra + Ecosystem Growth): **OCTANT ALONE** (orange sticky, stands out)
   - EigenLayer removed (Gabe's call — pivoted to AI, less relevant than Aave)
   - Gitcoin added next to Sky so Octant isn't the only "alone" one — but it IS the only DeFi protocol in ecosystem growth
3. **Messaging Comparison** — table frame created, needs content filled in
   - Columns: Protocol | Tagline | Homepage Stat | Social Proof | Security | Primary CTA | X Voice
   - 9 rows: Octant, Yearn, Aave, Morpho, Ether.fi, Sky, Pendle, Ethena, Lido
   - Full data provided to Gabe for each cell
   - Octant's row has ⚠️ gaps (no stats, no social proof, no security messaging)

### ALL 6 FRAMES COMPLETE ✅
4. **Key Findings** — 4 red stickies (stats buried, logos dim, no security, framing undersells) + 1 green (unique position)
5. **Design & Branding Comparison** — Side-by-side screenshots of Octant vs Morpho vs Aave vs Lido with analysis stickies
6. **Recommendations** — 5 green stickies (lead with numbers, bigger logos, security section, headline alternatives, evaluate RPG branding)

### Miro Board Link:
https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVGDqJIG4=/?share_link_id=301078348214

### Corrections Made During Session:
- Octant DOES have partner logos (EF, Protocol Guild, Yearn, Morpho) — just dim/subtle
- Octant DOES have stats (vault widget) — just buried, not in hero
- CTA is "Use Octant v2" / "Book a Demo" — NOT "Get in touch"
- Aave quotes have NO headshots — text only
- Updated table and key findings with accurate data

### Presentation Script:
- Saved to `memory/pm-presentation-script.md`
- Covers all 6 frames with what to say + possible Mashal questions + answers
- Sent full script to Gabe on Telegram (5 messages)
- Gabe messaged Mashal early — sent the Miro link ahead of Tuesday

### Portfolio Website Fixes:
- ✅ Vercel Deployment Protection disabled (was blocking all visitors with login wall)
- ✅ Fixed at project level (Settings → Deployment Protection → Vercel Authentication OFF)
- ✅ CTA button changed from "Work With Me" to "Hire Me" — deployed

### OpenAI/ChatGPT Access:
- ✅ ChatGPT Plus OAuth already configured in auth-profiles.json
- Account: gavafot@gmail.com, plan: Plus
- Token valid until Feb 15, 2026
- Provider: openai-codex, last used Feb 6 successfully
- Can use GPT-5.3-Codex through OpenClaw subscription auth (no API key needed)

### Aria's Ears (Live Transcription Tool):
- Built HTML page using Chrome Web Speech API at `live-transcribe/index.html`
- Served via http-server on port 8765
- **RESULT:** Picks up direct voice perfectly, but CANNOT pick up laptop speakers
- Gabe buying a **cabo P2 macho-macho** (3.5mm aux cable) to feed audio directly from Mac to my mic jack
- Will test with aux cable before Tuesday
- Backup plan: Telegram texting during meeting + filler phrases

## Supabase X Trend Tracker (Afternoon)
- **Supabase project created:** x-trend-tracker (São Paulo region, sa-east-1)
- **URL:** https://qmgxvmzydxxlfuxmfswy.supabase.co
- **Dashboard:** https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/qmgxvmzydxxlfuxmfswy
- **Schema deployed:** 10 tables, 4 views, 1 materialized view, all RLS enabled
- **Tables:** x_lists, trend_scans, trends, trend_scan_items, our_posts, post_metrics, engagements, engagement_metrics, list_activity, daily_stats
- **Views:** v_trend_velocity, v_post_performance, v_engagement_roi, v_best_posting_times, mv_weekly_summary
- **Seed data:** 6 X lists loaded (Brands, REDACTED, Based Intelligence, KOLs, Polymarket, Funny)
- **API keys saved:** secrets/supabase-x-trend-tracker.json
- **Claude Code session** `fresh-seaslug` did the schema planning (Opus 4.6 deep think) but got SIGKILL'd before writing plan.md. Aria rescued the full output and wrote plan.md + all migrations manually.
- **Approach:** Wrote 14 SQL migration files, combined them, pasted into Supabase SQL Editor via Monaco API (base64 decode trick), ran successfully in one shot.
- **Next:** Build Edge Functions to connect existing cron scans to write trend data

## Symbiotic Bug Bounty (Evening)
- Re-read all analysis docs, hooks contracts, Strategy V2
- **Finding 5:** NetworkRestakeDecreaseHook over-punishment (Low/Info)
- **Finding 6:** FullRestakeDecreaseHook zeroes network limit, de-stakes all operators (Medium) — **SUBMITTED on Cantina by Gabe**
- Ruled out: Hook gas partial execution (atomic), Redistribute hook temporal mismatch (formula correct)
- Multiple angles verified safe after exhaustive cross-contract tracing

## OKX DEX Router Audit (Evening)
- Re-verified all previous findings from Feb 5 with fresh eyes
- **4 NEW/UPDATED findings — ALL SUBMITTED on Cantina by Gabe:**
  1. **M: ExactOut Multi-Commission Under-Count** (STRONGEST) — `_beforeSwap()` sums only 2 of 8 commission rates, bricks 3+ referrer exact-out swaps
  2. **M: Arbitrary Commission Recipient** — unvalidated referrer addresses in calldata, up to 13% extraction via phishing
  3. **M: smartSwapByInvest Dust Sweep** — no access control, anyone can sweep router balances
  4. **L: .transfer() ETH Refund** — 2300 gas limit blocks smart contract wallets
- **Research context:** Dec 2023 OKX had $2.7M exploit via leaked proxy admin key. March 2025 Lazarus used OKX DEX. Current code is v1.0.7-multi-commission (new, less battle-tested). CertiK audit was May 2023 (pre multi-commission).
- Multi-commission finding targets NEW code not covered by prior audits

## Aria @AriaLinkwell Quote Repost
- Quote retweeted Gabe's Day 2 building-in-public tweet (2020583942706041150)
- Posted via browser (API returned 403, free tier issue)
- Gabe liked and reposted it
- Text: "built the full schema for this. 10 tables, 4 views, materialized weekly rollups, RLS. started as 'let me track some tweets' and turned into a real analytics backend. supabase free tier is wild. next: edge functions for zero-touch trend tracking across 600+ accounts."

## Job Opportunities (For Tomorrow Morning)
- **Orca PM** (via @EveyNFT tweet 2020579575051231542) — Solana DeFi Product Manager, remote. STRONG FIT.
- **Damian Player AI Engineer** (tweet 2020515419069485085) — fullstack, high agency, AI-native. DM him.
- **Phantom** — Senior Product Marketer + Lifecycle Marketing Lead (from earlier session)
- Felix Lee Claude Code Design Guide — saved to backlog (tweet 2018728056249254377)

## Research Bookmarked (Late Night)
- **@poof_eth agent coding tips** — saved to vibecoding-best-practices.md (dual wield models, minimize skills/MCP, have something to build)
- **Orca PM JD analyzed** — used as PM skills roadmap for Octant ($160-190K USDC role, not ready yet)
- **Vox 6-Agent Company** — Supabase + closed loop architecture, useful for Mashal AI workflow demo later
- **OneContext** — persistent context across sessions, backlogged (OpenClaw memory works fine)
- **Felix Lee, dimillian iOS, jacob.blog subscriptions** — skipped/backlogged

### Decisions:
- Miro blank board over template — more flexible for custom presentation
- EigenLayer dropped, Aave kept (bigger, more relevant)
- Gitcoin added to top-right with Sky to contrast Octant's unique position
- No "prepared by/for" on title slide
- PM Task 1 is DONE — Mashal notified early
