# Mashal 1-on-1 Script v2 — Post Team Meeting Framing

**Vibe:** Not an audition anymore. You got the role. This is alignment + showing you're already executing.

---

## OPENING (30 seconds)

"Hey Mashal, loved what you shared with the team today. I'm really excited about this role. I want to walk you through what I've already been working on, and then show you my board with everything I'm proposing and tracking."

---

## PART 1: MIRO COMPETITIVE RESEARCH (5-7 min)

Link: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVGDqJIG4=/

"So you mentioned research and insights into the ecosystem, competitors, the landscape. I actually already started on that. Let me walk you through what I found."

Walk through the 6 frames:
1. Title + methodology
2. Market Positioning Map — "We own our quadrant. No other protocol turns yield into ecosystem growth."
3. Messaging Comparison — how competitors frame themselves vs us
4. Key Findings — gaps and opportunities
5. Design & Branding comparison
6. Recommendations — "Lead the homepage with a real number"

**Landing line:** "This is the kind of research I'll be producing on a regular basis. Monthly competitive reports, landscape changes, new players entering our space."

## PART 2: NOTION MISSION CONTROL (5-7 min)

"Now let me show you how I'm tracking everything. I built this board to keep things organized and transparent."

Walk through the columns:

**Done (2):**
- X Automated Competitor Tracking System — "Already built an automated system that tracks competitor activity on X"
- Unfollow accounts not following us back — "Quick cleanup, done"

**In Progress (3):**
- Competitive Research Feb '26 — "What I just showed you on Miro"
- StreamYard Video Organization — "Working on getting those videos organized for Proton Drive"
- Dev Meeting Notes Template — "Now that I'm bridging tech and marketing, I'll produce a summary after every dev call. Key decisions, action items, and what marketing needs to know."

**Proposed (show the pipeline):**
- **n8n + AI Automation Layer** [HIGH] — "This is the big one. n8n is a free, open-source workflow automation tool. I can set up a competitor monitoring workflow that auto-tracks when Aave, Morpho, Lido post updates and sends us a summary. Zero cost, visual, secure. We can have the first one running this week."
- **Multi-Agent AI Workflows** [HIGH] — "For bigger tasks like automated content pipelines, I found a tool called Antfarm that runs teams of AI agents on deterministic workflows."
- **AI Content Repurposer** [HIGH] — "Takes our existing content and adapts it for different platforms"
- **AI Meeting Notes → Action Items Pipeline** — "Ties into the dev bridge role. Automated summaries after every meeting."
- **Octant KPI Dashboard (Dune)** [MEDIUM] — "Similar to what Q showed with the donor dashboard. I can build Dune dashboards tracking our ecosystem metrics."
- **Website Analytics Setup** [MEDIUM] — "I heard you're setting up Matomo. I can help define what we track and build conversion funnels."
- **User Feedback Collection System** [MEDIUM] — connects to what Borderless said about needing distribution
- **Monthly Competitive Reports** [LOW] — recurring version of what I just showed you
- **Sprint Cycles Proposal** [LOW] — "Bringing structure to how we plan and ship"

## PART 3: CONNECTING TO THE TEAM MEETING (2-3 min)

"Based on what you shared today, here's how I see my priorities aligning:"

1. **Tech bridge:** "I'll start attending dev calls this week. After each one, marketing gets a summary with what's shipping and what we need to communicate."

2. **Migration Resource Hub:** "I'll build the Notion resource hub you mentioned. I already looked at the v2 docs and the migration page. I know Epoch 11 opens Feb 18, migration is 3 on-chain transactions, time-weighted rewards mean early migration is better. Quick question: what's the full scope? Just the migration flow, or do you also want the v2 onboarding docs for new capital providers?"

3. **AI Prompt Library pickup:** "I noticed there's an AI Prompt Library initiative that Quentin started. I can pick that up and take it further with the 25 specialized marketing skills I've already set up. Instead of just a prompt library, we'd have actual automated workflows."

4. **Research automation:** "The n8n setup I proposed can automate a lot of the competitive monitoring. Instead of me manually checking, we get alerts when something changes."

## PART 4: ASK FOR INPUT (1 min)

"What's your take? Anything you'd want me to prioritize differently?"

---

## POWER PHRASES
- "I already started on that"
- "Here's what I found"
- "We can have this running this week"
- "Zero cost, open source"
- "I'll produce a summary after every dev call"
- "What would you prioritize?"

## AVOID
- "Great question!" (AI tell)
- Being defensive if she pushes back
- Over-explaining AI tools (keep it practical, not technical)
- Bullshitting — "Let me look into that" is always fine

## IF SHE ASKS:
- **"What's the cost?"** → "n8n is free, open source. AI tools run on existing budgets. The only cost is my time."
- **"Can you demo this?"** → "I can set up the first workflow today and show you results tomorrow."
- **"What about the migration timeline?"** → "I saw Epoch 11 allocation window opens Feb 18. I'll have the resource hub ready before that. The docs site is already live at docs.v2.octant.build."
- **"How do you prioritize?"** → "High-impact items first. The competitive research and n8n automation give us the most value fastest."
