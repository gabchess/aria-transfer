# Daily Notes — Feb 9, 2026

## SolGuard Hackathon — MASSIVE PROGRESS DAY

### Features Shipped
- **DexScreener Auto-Feed** — `src/lib/autofeed.ts` polls DexScreener every 60s, auto-scans Solana tokens. 37+ tokens scanned in first session. No API key needed.
- **Serial Rugger Leaderboard** — `src/components/SerialRuggerBoard.tsx` + API route + DB query. Claude Code on Gabe's Mac reviewed code, fixed NULL filters, Number() casts, and HAVING threshold.
- **Moved Leaderboard to own page** — `/leaderboard` route with nav link (Claude Code did this)
- **Fixed dashboard headline** — "SYSTEM_MONITOR::LIVE_FEED" → "Live Token Risk Monitor" (clean, professional)
- **Fixed scanner status** — Shows "AUTO_SCAN" green instead of "OFFLINE" when autofeed running
- **60-second demo script** — `DEMO-SCRIPT.md` committed to repo

### Aria X Account — RESTRICTED + FIXED
- **@AriaLinkwell temporarily restricted** due to Bird CLI automation attempts
- Error 226 from Bird CLI + Cloudflare captchas stacked up
- **ROOT CAUSE:** Bird CLI uses internal API (cookie-based), triggers anti-bot detection
- **FIX:** Use `twitter-api-poster.js` (official OAuth 1.0a API) — ALWAYS
- **Gabe unlocked the account** manually
- **Successfully posted via API:** https://x.com/AriaLinkwell/status/2020993635894939943
- **LESSON: NEVER use Bird CLI for @AriaLinkwell posting. API only. $0.01/tweet.**
- Updated TOOLS.md with this rule

### BTC Market Research

- Recommended: DCA R$500/week, increase if drops below $65K
- Saved to `memory/btc-research-2026-02-09.md`

### X Lists Scan
