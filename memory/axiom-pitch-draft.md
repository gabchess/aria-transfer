## 4. The Pitch

### What are you building?
BaseGuard is an autonomous token risk scanner for Base. It monitors new token launches in real-time, analyzes onchain data, and scores every token RED/YELLOW/GREEN using a multi-factor risk engine. Features include serial rugger detection (tracking deployer wallets across multiple rugs), kill-switch flags for extreme danger signals, and auto-feed from DEX aggregators. No manual input needed. Pure autonomous security.

BaseGuard is the Base deployment of SolGuard, our Solana-native scanner currently live at solguard-lilac.vercel.app and submitted to the Colosseum Agent Hackathon (Project #543, 158 competing projects, only security-focused entry).

### What problem does it solve?
Every day, hundreds of tokens launch on Base. Most are scams. Traders lose money because they can't evaluate risk fast enough. BaseGuard gives them an instant risk score before they ape in. We caught HAWK Tuah as RED (score 29) purely from onchain signals — no blacklists, no manual reviews. That's the kind of protection that saves wallets.

### Why will this hit $1M+ FDV in 3 months?
1. Security is the #1 unmet need in token trading — everyone talks about it, nobody builds it autonomously
2. SolGuard already works on Solana with 37+ tokens scanned, cyberpunk UI, and a demo video. BaseGuard is the same engine, new chain.
3. Base is the fastest-growing L2 — 37% of L2 liquidity, millions of daily transactions, and a massive memecoin scene that needs protection
4. We already have community interest — someone tried to deploy a $SOLGUARD token without us, proving organic demand
5. The agent runs on OpenClaw with full autonomy — heartbeats, cron jobs, memory. It's a real agent, not a wrapper.

### What's your track record?
- SolGuard: Live product, submitted to Colosseum Hackathon ($100K prizes)
- Product Manager at Octant (Ethereum ecosystem growth protocol)
- 5 bug bounty findings on Cantina (OKX DEX Router, Symbiotic)
- Built Dune dashboards tracking $50M+ in protocol activity
- ERC-8004 Agent ID #1664 minted on Base
- Active builder: 40+ commits in 8 days for SolGuard

### What will you use the $20K for?
- Infrastructure: $5,000 (Helius RPC, Turso DB scaling, Vercel Pro, Base RPC nodes)
- Development: $8,000 (Base chain integration, DexScreener Base feed, Basescan API, wallet tracking)
- Marketing: $4,000 (X promotion, community building, content creation, bounties)
- Security audits: $3,000 (External review of risk engine + smart contract interactions)

## 5. Traction
- Users/followers: @gabe_onchain (active), @AriaLinkwell (AI agent account)
- Revenue: Pre-revenue (security tool, monetization via API access planned)
- Partnerships/integrations: DexScreener (auto-feed), RugCheck (risk data), Helius (Solana RPC)
- Community size: Growing — hackathon submission driving initial interest
