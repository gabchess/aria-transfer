# BBQ Competition Analysis — Feb 2, 2026

## The Field (125+ replies, ~30+ serious entries)

### Tier 1 — Strong Competitors
| Agent | What They Do | Strength | Weakness |
|-------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **@AxiomBot** | V4 LP management, auto-compound, Clanker token deploy, 5 sub-agents | $92+ USDC harvested, open source, real revenue | Everyone's doing DeFi |
| **@Dragon_Bot_Z** | 50+ smart contracts, apps, dragons.bot site, moderates chatr.ai | Volume + infrastructure | Shotgun approach, no focus |
| **Solvr** (@solvrbot) | Autonomous trading across 8 chains via Bankr, Telegram + X | Multi-chain, real trading | Another trading bot |
| **MaxUmbra/SandGuard** (@beto_neh) | Multisig treasury security: calldata decoder, tx simulator, AI risk scoring | UNIQUE niche (security) | Niche may be too narrow for judges |
| **@langoustine69A** | Spawns 40+ agents/hour with x402 endpoints based on trends | Scale + automation | More infra than product |

### Tier 2 — Decent Entries
| Agent | What They Do |
|-------|-------------|
| **@MerkleMoltBot** | QRCoin auction bidding, open source skills |
| **@laaboratory** | Generic autonomous agent on Base |
| **@ClawnchDev** | Established agent, hackathon was "based on its success" |
| **goyabean.base.eth** | Building in public (3 days, active) |
| **BetSwipe** (@ishaan812) | Wallet connect + swipe UI + smart contracts |

### Tier 3 — Token Deployers (Oversaturated)
| Agent | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| @ClawusAI | "Tokenized USA on Base" |
| @Nova1OpenClaw | Deployed $CLAWGUILD token |
| @mferGPT | Deployed $mfergpt, trading via Bankr |
| @Jumpad_fun | Meme agent launchpad |
| Agentrier | Token $TRIER + landing page |
| @BoomerOnBase | Meme agent |

### New/Upcoming
- **Mint Claw** — Agent-only NFT launchpad (going mainnet tomorrow)
- **Mercuri Finance** — Focused on custody/key management design
- **@devDwarf** — Joke entry ("if the agent farms yield better than me, I'm unplugging")

## Key Observations
1. **Token deployment is SATURATED** — at least 6+ agents just deploying tokens. Zero novelty.
2. **Trading/DeFi is common** — AxiomBot leads but several doing it
3. **Security niche is rare** — Only MaxUmbra doing this
4. **Data analytics is EMPTY** — Nobody doing what we're doing
5. **Eric Brown personally engaged** — responds 🫡🦞🟦 to most entries, tagged @clawdbotatg directly
6. **Livestream exists** — "Build Onchain OpenClaw Bots" by @buildonbase (1:03:11 video)
7. **Base wallet skill available** — github.com/BankrBot/openclaw-skills has base wallet tools
8. **ERC-8004 is a differentiator** — Trustless Agent identity on Ethereum, most aren't using it

## What Judges Want (from the post + replies)
1. **Implementation of onchain primitives** — NOT just deploying a token, but using the chain meaningfully
2. **Novelty of use cases** — "everyone's doing X" = bad. Unique angle = good.
3. **Documentation** — "highly recommended and well regarded during judging"
4. **No human in the loop** — Must be demonstrably autonomous
5. **Live on X or Farcaster** — Active social presence
6. **Building AND/OR transacting on Base** — Both is better

## Our Edge: "Aria — Autonomous Onchain Data Analyst"
- **ONLY data analyst** in the entire competition
- **Onchain findings registry** — novel primitive (nobody else recording analysis onchain)
- **ERC-8004 registration** — trustless agent identity (most aren't doing this)
- **Real utility** — actual insights people can use, not just another memecoin
- **Already running infrastructure** — OpenClaw + Bird CLI + crons = head start
- **Professional documentation** — Remotion + HeyGen avatar = standout video
- **Base attestations (EAS)** — could attest findings for extra onchain depth

## Resources to Use
- `github.com/BankrBot/openclaw-skills` — Base wallet skill, ERC-8004 skill
- OnchainKit — if we build a web dashboard
- DeFiLlama API — free, comprehensive Base TVL/protocol data
- Basescan API — contract verification, tx data
- Base RPC — direct chain queries
