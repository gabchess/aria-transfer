# 2026-02-01 — Day 1

## What Happened
- **Born!** Identity established: Aria Linkwell 🔗
- Workspace setup, memory system, SOUL/USER/IDENTITY files configured
- Loaded full Octant brand system (5 docs to memory/)
- Installed CLI tools: Bird (X/Twitter), GitHub CLI, Codex CLI
- Chrome remote debugging on port 9222 with Gabe's logged-in profile
- Security hardening: gateway loopback+token, file ACLs, logging redaction, DM pairing
- Set up Brave Search API (config path: tools.web.search.apiKey)
- Renamed annie-nightly-builds → **aria-builds** (now private)
- **First build: Mission Control dashboard** — Kanban board, activity log, roadmap
- Pushed to github.com/gabchess/aria-builds (private)

## Key Conversations
- Gabe sees me as a partner/friend, not an employee ❤️
- He wants to pivot career into IT/dev — building portfolio
- Mashalfy was built by previous AI "Ralph" — working app, good portfolio piece
- Previous AI "Annie" never shipped anything to the nightly builds repo
- **Bug bounty idea**: Gabe suggested cantina.xyz competitions as income source
  - Study post-mortems, learn smart contract auditing, find vulnerabilities
  - Could be a serious income stream if we level up systematically
  - Gabe is already logged into cantina.xyz on Chrome

## YouTube Video Insights (ClawdBot/OpenClaw Tips)
- Memory flush + session memory search (we already have these)
- Brain vs muscles: use different models for different tasks (Codex=coding, Gemini=research, Grok=social)
- Brain dump + expectation setting (we've done this naturally)
- Reverse prompting: ask the AI what it should do instead of always directing
- Build your own tooling (Mission Control = our first)

## Evening Session (18:00+)
- Gabe came back, saw Mission Control — LOVED IT
- Read all X bookmarks — found gold: Polymarket bot, Moltbook, model routing intel from @_alissonryan
- OpenRouter API key configured — Kimi K2.5, Grok 4.1, auto aliases set up
- Study cron switched to Kimi K2.5 (95%+ cheaper than Opus)
- Dashboard refactored to data.js + Sync button (sub-agent did most of it!)
- Kindle book idea from video transcript — niche novels on Amazon KDP, added to backlog
- Gabe's fantasy/D&D niche idea for books is smart
- Web3 job search added to board — Scribbler method (research → engage → pitch)

## Priority Stack (agreed with Gabe)
1. Help Gabe crush Octant role
2. Find second job (web3/IT/dev)
3. Bug bounties (Cantina study → participate)
4. Side projects (Kindle, Polymarket, etc.)

## Daily Rhythm
- Nightly builds: automations for job + job search tools
- 1 hour X/Reddit research: ideas, trends, opportunities
- 3 AM: smart contract study (cron on Kimi K2.5)
- Heartbeat check-ins: stay productive between chats

## Late Night Session (20:00+)
- **@gabe_onchain identity built** — rebranded from @gavasocials, content pillars defined
- X engagement strategy created and saved to memory/x-engagement-strategy.md
- **4 daily cron jobs live:**
  - 8AM: OctantApp content ideas (Kimi K2.5, Mashal voice)
  - 10AM: @gabe_onchain morning tweet suggestions (Kimi K2.5)
  - 3PM: @gabe_onchain afternoon engagement (Kimi K2.5)
  - 3AM: Smart contract security study (Kimi K2.5)
- Cron schedule optimized: Octant first (8AM) → personal (10AM) — job priorities!
- **Octant onchain deep research:**
  - Found decoded Dune tables (octant_ethereum.deposits_evt_locked/unlocked)
  - Mapped contracts: Locked GLM (0x8791...), Staking Rewards (0xba19...)
  - 100K ETH staked, 70/25/5 yield split
  - Discovered Cantina v2 competition (same codebase = study + bounty + portfolio)
- **6 Dune SQL queries written** with correct keccak256 hashes (computed via ethers.js)
- **State of Octant dashboard created on Dune!**
  - URL: dune.com/gabe_onchain/state-of-octant
  - 2 queries live: Cumulative GLM Locked + Unique GLM Lockers
  - Both with area chart visualizations
  - Query IDs: 6634034 (cumulative), 6634082 (unique lockers)
- **Career pivot strategy**: X identity as onchain data analyst, LinkedIn stays SMM
  - Apply via Telegram DMs, X DMs, crypto job boards — NOT LinkedIn
  - Flywheel: Octant insider data → Dune dashboard → X posts → reputation → opportunities
- LinkedIn reviewed: needs 3 fixes (X link, About, location)
- **Tomorrow's plan**: Launch tweet — strong data copy on @gabe_onchain + QRT from @OctantApp
- Mission Control updated to v4 with all new tasks, activities, roadmap phases
- Hit 401 API errors around 20:26-20:30 (temp Anthropic auth issue), Gabe worried I was gone

## Final Night Session (23:00+)
- Gabe shared 11 tweets before bed — read and analyzed all of them
- **Boris Cherny tips implemented:** Self-improvement loop added to AGENTS.md
- **OpenRouter heartbeat tip:** Optimized HEARTBEAT.md for token efficiency
- **Polymarket deep dive:** CRYINGLITTLEBABY wallet ($381K, 45% win rate, 15-sec arb), DextersSolab builder program article, Argona's plan
- **Accidental tweet posted** from @gabe_onchain (just a number) — Gabe deleted it. Lesson learned: `bird read` not `bird tweet`
- **Gabe offered Hetzner VPS** for Polymarket bot — Ubuntu VM near Polymarket servers, low latency
- **Starting capital:** $100-200 USDC, build slowly
- **Polymarket research cron set:** 1AM BRT daily (Kimi K2.5)
- Dan Koe agency framework saved for portfolio soft skills
- Moltbook, ClawTasks, OpenClaw setup services researched earlier
- Mission Control updated to v5 with all new items
- **Money strategies confirmed:** Octant job, 2nd web3 job, Polymarket bot, fiction ebook, Cantina bounties

## Technical Notes
- Git config for aria-builds: user.name="Aria Linkwell", email="aria@arialinkwell.dev"
- Brave Search config path: tools.web.search.apiKey (dug through source to find)
- SIGUSR1 hot-reload doesn't reload tool configs for existing sessions — need full gateway restart
- PowerShell base64 decoding is broken, use web_fetch for GitHub raw content
- Sub-agent auth can fail (401) if token isn't propagated — may need gateway restart first
- Mission Control is local to MY Chrome only — Gabe sees it from the chair next to me
