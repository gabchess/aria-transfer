# Dune Dashboard Tweet Drafts — @gabe_onchain
*Following voice-gabe.md strictly. Zero banned words/patterns.*

## Option A: Learning in public + data reveal
```
Built my first Dune dashboard tracking Octant's onchain data.

~154M GLM locked across [X] unique wallets. 10 epochs completed. Over 2,000 ETH distributed to public goods projects since launch.

Numbers paint the full picture. Link below 📊

```

## Option B: Data-first hook
```
What does 100K staked ETH actually produce?

10 epochs. [X] unique lockers. [X]M GLM locked. Thousands of ETH back to the community.

I built a dashboard to track it all onchain. Every lock, unlock, and trend since day one.

```

## Option C: Day N learning format
```
Day [N] of learning onchain analytics.

Built a State of Octant dashboard on Dune. Tracks GLM locking trends, user growth, top participants, and monthly activity.

All from raw ERC-20 transfer events on the Deposits contract. No API dependency.

## QRT Suggestion for @OctantApp

*Gabe posts from @gabe_onchain first. Then from @OctantApp, quote retweet with:*

### Option 1:
```
Data-driven breakdown of what Octant looks like onchain.

[QRT Gabe's tweet]
```

### Option 2:
```
One of our community members built an independent dashboard tracking GLM locking activity across all epochs.

The data speaks for itself.

### Option 3:
```
What 10 epochs of community governance looks like in raw numbers.

## Posting Strategy
1. Gabe posts from @gabe_onchain with dashboard link
2. Wait 15-30 min for initial engagement
3. Gabe QRTs from @OctantApp (amplification)
4. Optional: Reply thread with 2-3 key findings from the dashboard data

## Reply Thread Ideas (add under main tweet)
- "Biggest finding: [X]% of GLM is held by the top 20 lockers. The long tail is [Y] wallets with less than 1K GLM each."
- "New locker growth peaked in [month/year] with [X] first-time lockers. [Context about what was happening with Octant then]."
- "Lock vs unlock ratio tells you community conviction. Months where locks > unlocks by [X]x: [list months]."
