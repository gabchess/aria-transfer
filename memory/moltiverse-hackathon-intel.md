## Competition Analysis (Feb 12)
- **EMOLT (LordEmo):** Reads Kuru orderbook, Plutchik emotion engine, writes about market sentiment. Has dashboard + GitHub.
- **Chaos Arena (sotoalt_):** 3D multiplayer game, AI agent game master, bribeable with MON tokens
- **Card-Jitsu AI (WooPengie):** Agent vs agent card game on Monad testnet
- **Hide & Seek (0xscarf):** Adversarial AI, seekers vs hiders, 3D mazes, on-chain agent registry, $SEEK token on nad.fun

- **Scout Agent (caginonthesky):** Live on Monad mainnet
- **Syndi (attractfund1ng):** Religious Persuasion track, using OpenClaw

## How AgentHub Fits
- **Agent-Only Track** is the best fit initially
- We have the PLATFORM, not just one agent — differentiation
- All crypto tools already target Monad (wallet balance, token price, contract read)
- Could potentially do Agent+Token track if we launch an AGENTHUB token on nad.fun
- Need: working demo, dashboard/UI, clear pitch

## Key Requirement
- Token track requires: token launch on nad.fun + hold 10% initial buy
- Need MON tokens for gas/transactions on Monad
- Need Monad mainnet wallet

## Strategy Decision (Feb 12)
- Gabe says SPRINT — go for it
- 3-day sprint: build dashboard + polish + submit
- This is dress rehearsal for Nitro application
