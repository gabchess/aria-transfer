# 2026-02-13 — Full Day Session

## Evening Updates
- Superteam Academy: skipping tweet + fork/PR to solanabr repo. Submission already done, no extra steps needed.
- Portfolio website confirmed LIVE and updated — no more "Aria Mission Control". Gabe may need to hard refresh (cache).
- Tomorrow plan: AgentHub Week 3 + UI polish with Claude Code
- Gabe learned what a PR (Pull Request) is — fork someone's repo, add code, open PR to merge

## Claude Code Week 1+2 COMPLETE
- Claude Code shipped ALL Week 1 (10 tasks) + ALL Week 2 (3 tasks) in ONE afternoon
- Week 2: Dashboard XP components, Dashboard quick wins (step preview, run timer, health dot), Whale Tracker workflow
- Both backend + dashboard compile clean
- Committed + pushed to GitHub

## Awesome CTO Repo Digested
- Scraped full README from github.com/kuchin/awesome-cto (34K stars)
- Curated picks saved at `memory/awesome-cto-picks.md`
- PM articles for Gabe, security resources for AgentHub CTO agent
- Gabe said: don't create Notion cards, implement tips internally for AgentHub agents

## Helius Wallet API Integrated into SolGuard
- Gabe signed up, API key: saved to `secrets/helius.json` + `.env.local`
- New v1 functions: getWalletBalances(), getWalletTransfers(), getWalletFunding()
- Risk engine upgraded with funding source analysis (exchange +10, mixer -30)
- Scanner calls getWalletFunding(deployer) on every scan
- Pushed to GitHub (commit 10e9b4a), Vercel env var set, redeployed
- **Balances API confirmed working**, funding endpoint returned "method not found" (may still be beta)

## Blog Post Updates (Graven Feedback)
- Graven gave gold feedback: circular vs linear v2, Superfluid "streaming" overlap, hub-and-spoke diagram, negative framing
- Applied 4 text changes: "streaming" → "accumulating continuously", flipped negative framing to positive
- Claude Code generated 3 new Excalidraw diagrams on Mac (v1-vs-v2, migration-flow, ecosystem-vision)
- Added nicnode migration video placeholder paragraph
- Sarah looped in for diagram polish (Mashal approved)

## Superteam Academy — POLISHED + DEPLOYED + SUBMITTED ✅
- Claude Code polished: landing page (296 insertions), Solana theme (#9945FF/#14F195), 4 courses/34 lessons, course cards with badges, challenge panel with confetti, README
- Then polished: leaderboard (avatars, medals, XP bars, LATAM usernames), dashboard (stat cards, gradient XP, streak calendar, 8 achievements), profile (skill radar hexagon chart!, credentials, completed courses)
- Deployed: https://superteam-academy-nine.vercel.app
- **SUBMITTED on Superteam Earn** ✅ (4th Superteam submission total)
- Submission: GitHub link + live demo + stack description
- Still TODO: tweet @SuperteamBR, fork + PR to solanabr/superteam-academy, demo video (optional)
- Idea: pitch to Q as Octant internal knowledge hub (R&D Lab pillar)

## Portfolio Updated + Redesigned
- Content: Added AgentHub, Superteam Academy, Octant Card; updated SolGuard with Helius; PM role in hero; updated about section
- Removed: Aria Mission Control + "This Portfolio" (filler)
- Claude Code visual polish: gradient mesh hero, rotating terminal subtitle with blinking cursor, "I ship things in web3" tagline, dot grid, glow cards, deeper dark theme
- Tab reorder: AI → Data → Social (Security hidden until bounty win)
- LIVE: https://gabeonchain.vercel.app

## Decisions
- **Cursor subscription CANCELED** — Claude Code is better
- **Antigravity Pro kept ($20/mo)** — But Claude Code will likely handle RPG cards too
- **Security tab hidden on portfolio** — Until first bounty payout
- **Product Manager hidden from hero subtitles** — Gabe wants to prove it first
- **aria-onchain-analyst repo → PRIVATE** ✅
- **octant-card repo → PRIVATE** ✅
- **Git author fix:** Must commit as gavafotos@gmail.com for Vercel deploys (Aria's email gets rejected)

## Coinbase Challenge
- Results came out: we didn't win. Winner was within $3M of actual FY 2025 revenue. Our $6.88B estimate was solid but not close enough.

## Tomorrow's Plan
1. Tweet about Superteam Academy (tag @SuperteamBR) + add to submission
2. Send Q the Superteam → Octant knowledge hub pitch
3. Fork solanabr/superteam-academy + open PR
4. AgentHub Week 3 with Claude Code (on-chain traces, E2E, demo prep)
5. Send Graven reply about blog feedback
6. Send Sarah the diagram polish message
