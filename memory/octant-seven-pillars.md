# Octant Seven Pillars (Priority Order) — from internal doc

## Core Identity
**Octant v2 = open public infrastructure for sustainable growth**
- Uses DeFi primitives for flexible funding allocations
- Regenerative funding streams + allocation mechanisms
- NOT a grants platform. NOT "public goods funding."
- Building Ethereum's R&D Engine + Narrative Leader

## The Seven Pillars
1. **Financial Sustainability & Security** — runway, revenue independence, avoid "Grants-as-a-Service"
2. **R&D Lab, Organization & Culture** — culture-first, learning-driven, 4-6 week experiment cycles
3. **Brand, Legitimacy & Narrative** — thought leadership, build in public, creator economy
4. **Sustainable Growth Funding Model** — the core problem being solved
5. **OADE Experimentation Surface** — learning & growth, partner relationships
6. **Vault & Capital Infrastructure Layer** — long-term capital onboarding
7. **R&D Network & Ecosystem Growth** — ecosystem relationships

## Strategic Shift
- **FROM:** Generic Grant Platform
- **TO:** Narrative Leader & Experimentation Hub

## v2 Architecture
- **Funding Vaults** — ERC-4626 compliant, deploy capital into DeFi yield strategies
- **Routing & Splitting** — programmatic yield distribution to multiple recipients
- **Allocation Mechanisms** — quadratic funding, QV, token-weighted voting
- **Community Staking** — stake ecosystem tokens, earn rewards, participate in allocation
- **Dragon Vaults** — Safe multisig integration for institutional treasuries

## Key Design Principles
- Capital Preservation (principal untouched, only yield flows)
- Credible Neutrality (doesn't prescribe what to fund, standardizes how)
- Sustainability (yield-based = continuous without depleting reserves)
- Composability (ERC-4626, Safe, Aave, Morpho, Sky)
- Cost-efficiency & Automation

## Language Guide for Content
✅ USE: sustainable growth, ecosystem funding, capital preservation, yield-based, infrastructure, R&D engine, DeFi primitives, funding streams
❌ AVOID: public goods (too vague), grants platform, charity, DAO tooling

## PS from the doc
"Octant is NOT just about 'giving out grants.' We're building Ethereum's R&D Engine and positioning as a Narrative Leader. The grants are just one tool in a bigger toolkit."
