# Staking Without Deadlines. Welcome to Octant v2.

*Draft v2 — Feb 13, 2026*
*Target: ~500 words | Status: Ready for Q + Mashal review*

---

Over 10 epochs, thousands of you locked GLM, funded projects you believe in, and pushed millions in matching toward causes that matter. You did all of it on a 90-day clock.

That clock served us well. But we kept hearing the same thing.

"Why can't I just stake when I'm ready?"

Fair question.

## What's changing

Octant v2 removes the epoch calendar from staking entirely.

Stake your GLM whenever you want. Unstake whenever you want. Earn WETH rewards every second your tokens are in the contract. No 90-day cycles. No allocation windows you can't afford to miss. No penalties for showing up late.

Rewards are distributed linearly over 30-day cycles. Your share is proportional to your stake relative to everyone else in the pool. There's no minimum. The math is simple: 1 GLM staked = 1 unit of earning power.

Epochs were a bus schedule. The bus left every 90 days whether you were on it or not. Octant v2 runs on your schedule.

## What stays the same

You're still locking GLM to earn individual rewards. Those rewards still represent your voting power in future Golem Foundation funding rounds. You can still claim and withdraw them.

The first funding round on v2 is a few months out. Until then, the app focuses on locking and rewards. But when rounds launch, this will be your access point to everything: quadratic funding rounds, community rounds, streaming experiments, all of it, accessible from a single application.

## What to expect during migration

Epoch 11 will be a Migration Epoch. Your goal is simple: move your GLM lock from v1 into v2. Three on-chain transactions.

1. Unlock your GLM from v1
2. Approve the token allowance for v2
3. Lock into v2

If you already have a v2 position, the migration increases your existing balance. One address, one position. Rewards start streaming the moment you migrate.

After the migration period, v1 moves toward sunset. GLM in v1 will no longer earn rewards, but you'll still be able to access v1 to withdraw and migrate.

## Why this matters beyond Golem

Here's the part that gets us excited.

This system is no longer specific to Golem Foundation. Any ecosystem or community can deploy the same infrastructure with their own tokens and funding parameters. A DAO funding local builders. A protocol distributing grants to contributors. A community running preference votes on chain.

Maybe this time next year, you'll be participating in multiple Octant v2 implementations across different ecosystems. Sustainable funding and high-quality preference aggregation, coexisting in web3 and beyond.

## Ready to migrate?

We'll share the exact timeline soon. When the Migration Epoch opens, head to the Octant app to move your GLM. Three transactions, a few minutes, and you're earning on your own terms.

## Diagram Prompts (Eraser.io — Octant brand colors: dark #171717, cream #FEFDF4, orange #FF9602)

### Diagram 1: v1 vs v2 Staking Model
Side-by-side comparison. Left: "Octant v1 (Epochs)" as a circular rigid loop with blocky boxes: Lock GLM → Wait ~90 days → Allocation Window → Receive ETH → Repeat. Gray/muted tones. Right: "Octant v2" as a smooth continuous flowing line: Stake GLM anytime → WETH rewards stream continuously → Unstake anytime. Orange (#FF9602) highlight on the v2 side. Arrow between them labeled "Migration". Clean, minimal, dark background (#171717), cream text (#FEFDF4).

### Diagram 2: Migration Flow (3 Steps)
Horizontal 3-step flow on dark background (#171717). Step 1: "Unlock GLM from v1" (open lock icon, cream). Step 2: "Approve token allowance" (checkmark icon, cream). Step 3: "Lock into Octant v2" (closed lock icon, orange #FF9602). Below step 3: "Rewards start streaming immediately" in orange. Dotted note: "Already have a v2 position? Migration increases your existing balance." Clean arrows between steps. No mention of RegenStaker.

### Diagram 3: Octant v2 Ecosystem Vision
Concentric circles or hub-and-spoke on dark background (#171717). Center hub: "Octant v2 Protocol" in orange (#FF9602). Spokes radiating out to: "Golem Foundation Rounds", "Community Funding", "Streaming QF", "DAO Grant Programs", "Ecosystem Voting", "Partner Rounds". Outer ring label: "Any ecosystem. Any token. Any funding model." Cream text (#FEFDF4). Shows the multi-ecosystem future, not just Golem.
