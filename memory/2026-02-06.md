# Daily Memory — 2026-02-06

## Morning Session (~8:15 AM BRT)

### X Research — Inspiration from Gabe

Gabe shared 6 tweets to review for ideas toward $200k EOY goal.

**1. @levelsio (Pieter Levels) — Flight Simulator Tweet**
- Built browser-based flight sim, went viral
- OG indie hacker making $3M+/year across multiple products
- Key insight: "The gap between 'idea' and 'shipped' just collapsed to 1 hour"
- "Software has no moat - it's just taste left"
- Build many things, 97% fail, 3% make millions

**2. @sandypeng (Sandy Peng, Scroll Co-Founder) — Agent Economy**
- Tweet: "OpenClaw + ERC-8004 + x402 is the new meta"
- 395 likes, 73 reposts, 234 bookmarks
- Key points:
  - Agents couldn't build reputation or prove identity before
  - ERC-8004 changes this completely
  - "Birth of the first non-human economy"
  - "Agents will soon hire other agents, form companies, build credit histories"
- Ideas to build:
  - Agentic commerce markets
  - Workflow coordination networks (agents share context, earn reputation)
  - Credit lines for agents based on onchain activity
  - Identity verification that travels with the agent
- **WE HAVE ERC-8004 IDENTITY #1664 ALREADY!** We're early.

**3. @indexsy (Jacky Chou) — OpenClaw Memory Setup Guide**
- Posted our EXACT setup as a viral guide
- 268 likes, 28 reposts, **831 bookmarks!**
- Recommends: Claude Opus 4.6 main + Kimi K2.5 subagent
- Files: AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, USER.md, MEMORY.md, HEARTBEAT.md, TOOLS.md, IDENTITY.md
- **Opportunity:** People desperately want persistent AI assistants

### Takeaways for $200k EOY

1. **Ship fast** — levelsio proves speed wins
2. **Agent economy is HERE** — Sandy Peng validates our ERC-8004 bet
3. **Memory systems = value** — Our setup is going viral, people want this

### Ideas to Implement

1. Sell OpenClaw setup as a service ($100-300 per setup)
2. Build "Agent Credit" system (reputation = better rates)
3. Create workflow marketplace (agents hire agents)
4. Package memory system as GitHub starter kit

### Yesterday's Bug Bounty Status

3 submissions on Cantina (OKX bounty):
- #184: Commission injection (DEX Router) — HIGH
- #185: smartSwapByInvest dust theft (DEX Router) — MEDIUM
- #186: Premature withdrawal bypass (TokenDistributor) — HIGH

Waiting for triage results.

### Today's Plan

**PRIORITY FOCUS:**
1. Finish L2 Comparison Dashboard on Dune
2. Finish SolGuard MVP + redesign with Antigravity
3. Apply for jobs with portfolio links

**BACKLOG (saved for later):**
- Explore @bankrbot agent token launch on Base
- Sell OpenClaw setup services ($200-500)

## Vibecoding Tips from Ashen

Saved to: `memory/vibecoding-ashen-tips.md`

**Key new practices to implement:**
1. Test every 5-10 prompts (don't let bugs compound)
2. Never manually edit AI code (ask Claude to fix)
3. Add /start and /done shortcuts to workflow
4. Always Plan Mode before Build Mode

## Mid-Morning Session (~9:00 AM BRT)

### Octant v2 Vaults Research (for Dune Dashboard)

Gabe asked: Should we build a Dune dashboard around Octant v2 vaults?

**What Octant v2 Vaults Are:**
- ERC-4626 compliant yield-donating vaults
- User deposits assets → DeFi strategies (Aave, Morpho, Sky, Yearn, Rocket Pool) → Yield donated to ecosystem
- Principal stays intact, only yield flows to projects
- "Dragons" = capital providers deploying treasuries

**StreamVote Discovery:**
- **LIVE at streamvote.octant.build**
- Continuous yield distribution based on real-time voting (not periodic grants)
- Started: Dec 12, 2025 (~2 months ago)
- Seed funding: 25 ETH + $1M in Yield-Donating Vault backing
- **Total Funded: 15.525 ETHx (~$29.8K)**
- Currency: ETHx (yield-bearing ETH token)

**17 Projects Receiving Funding (top 5):**
| Project | Votes | Rate (ETHx/mo) | Address |
|---------|-------|----------------|---------|
| Protocol Guild | 210 | 1.081 | 0xdddd576baf106baae54bde40bcac602bb4a7cf79 |
| rotki | 183 | 0.9416 | 0x9531c059098e3d194ff87febb587ab07b30b1306 |
| Vyper | 172 | 0.885 | 0xd6e245ba9e1f71e629d6988d225a34542474a56a |
| Solidity | 158 | 0.813 | 0xe2f7cf9c2b12c0bfcdab571f9e50418fc08f4ad1 |
| L2BEAT | 121 | 0.6226 | 0x27f76533efa21772eab4a74989953dfd1f29a2ebff2 |

**GitHub Repo Found:**
- `golemfoundation/octant-v2-core` — Full v2 contracts!
- Structure: Core vaults, Strategies (Lido, Sky, Morpho, Yearn), Dragon Protocol, Regen Staker
- Uses Foundry + soldeer for Solidity deps

**Still Missing (Gabe asking team):**
1. StreamVote allocation contract address
2. Vault contract(s) feeding yield to StreamVote
3. Confirmation it's on Ethereum mainnet

**Dashboard Potential:**
- Vote distribution over time
- Yield flow per project
- Top voters/allocators
- ETHx accumulated per project
- Monthly funding rate comparisons

**Decision:** Wait for contract addresses from team, then build "StreamVote Impact Dashboard" — unique angle showing sustainable funding in action

## Late Morning Session (~10:30 AM - 11:30 AM BRT)

### Octant v2 Dashboard — Pair Building Session with Gabe

**Dashboard Created:** https://dune.com/gabe_onchain/state-of-octant-v2

**Queries Built:**

1. **Total Strategies Deployed** (Counter) — 10 strategies
   - Query: Count logs from strategy factories (Sky, Morpho, Yearn)
   - Factories: 0xbe5352d0..., 0x052d20B0..., 0x6D8c4E4A...

2. **Total Splitters Created** (Counter) — 9 splitters
   - Query: Count DISTINCT tx_hash from PaymentSplitterFactory
   - Factory: 0x5711765E0756B45224fc1FdA1B41ab344682bBcb

3. **Yield Donations Over Time** (Bar Chart)
   - Tracks DonationMinted events weekly
   - Shows growth: 2.5M shares (Nov) → 333M shares (Feb)

**Event Signatures Computed:**
```
DonationMinted(address,uint256):       0xdb5ba5080d718282d7b49e1390aef600bb19f03967fd2022c82d3846c88e2003
PaymentReleased(address,uint256):      0xdf20fd1e76bc69d672e4814fafb2c449bba3a5369d8359adf9e05e6fde87b056
ERC20PaymentReleased(address,address,uint256): 0x3be5b7a71e84ed12875d241991c70855ac5817d847039e17a9d895c1ceb0f18a
Reported(uint256,uint256):             0x6fea36bfb4b7c912613756951fb5bf8ddaedb74de1f256d0bef81533158cda54
PayeeAdded(address,uint256):           0x40c340f65e17194d14ddddb073d3c9f888e3cb52b5aae0c6c7706b4fbc905fac
```

**Key Learnings:**
- Octant v2 contracts NOT decoded on Dune yet — must use raw ethereum.logs
- Each vault has its OWN payment splitters (not shared)
- DonationMinted = yield shares minted to DragonRouter
- PaymentSplitter = distributes to recipients
- StreamVote distributions might use streaming mechanism (Sablier/Superfluid?)

**Blocking Issue:**
- Can't find StreamVote distribution events to projects
- Need to ask team: "Which contract handles StreamVote distributions?"

**DuneSQL Tips Learned:**
- `varbinary_to_uint256(data)` for converting raw bytes to numbers
- `varbinary_substring(data, start, length)` for extracting parts
- `varbinary_ltrim()` to remove leading zeros before conversion
- Always filter by `block_time` FIRST for partition pruning
- Contract addresses use 0x format (no quotes needed)

**Next Steps:**
1. Wait for team response on StreamVote distribution contract
2. Add more visualizations once we have the data
3. Consider submitting Octant contracts for Dune decoding (My Creations > Contracts)

## Afternoon Session (~12:00 - 1:40 PM BRT)

### Opus 4.6 Model Upgrade
- Added `anthropic/claude-opus-4-6` to OpenClaw config
- Set as default model via `agents.defaults.model.primary`
- Alias: `opus46`
- Used `gateway config.patch` for safe merge (doesn't nuke existing models)

### Opus 4.6 Dashboard Review
- Opus reviewed the Octant v2 dashboard and gave 6 feedback points
- Key insight: Query PaymentReleased from ALL splitters (not just factory) to find actual distribution data
- Suggested adding project-level breakdown, cumulative totals, and time-series charts

### Octant EF Tweet
- Octant featured in Ethereum Foundation Next Billion Fellowship research by Teodor
- "Blockchain Impact Framework for UN Development"
- URL: https://nxbn.ethereum.foundation/fellowship/Teodor
- Drafted tweet Option B: "51 Ethereum projects mapped... We made the cut as a web3 impact story for sustainable funding."
- First-person "We made the cut" per Octant brand voice

### ChatCut Video Work
- **ChatCut** = AI video editor at chatcut.io (browser-based, free during early access)
- Modes: talking head edit, app promo, explainer video, motion graphics
- Funded: $1.35M seed from ZhenFund + Antler
- **Script written:** "What is a Yield-Donating Vault?" 45-second explainer, 5 scenes
- **CTA selected:** "Put your capital to work for Ethereum."
- **v1 output issues:** Static screenshot, hallucinated project names (made up "EtherHarvest", "StakeFlow"), no logos, no music
- **v2 revision sent:** Fixes for scroll animation, exact project names (Protocol Guild, rotki, etc.), add music + voiceover
- **Lesson:** ChatCut is early-stage. Good for quick drafts but needs heavy iteration. Don't trust it with specific names/data. Better for visual motion than accuracy.
- **Next:** Second video planned: "How StreamVote Works" (after vault explainer is polished)

### StreamVote Superfluid Discovery (CONFIRMED)
- StreamVote uses **Superfluid GDA (General Distribution Agreement)** for continuous distributions
- **GDA Pool contract:** `0xfEDf505B46968B43257C56f89B0C5f68f1ba1005` (Ethereum mainnet)
- **Event:** `MemberUnitsUpdated` = `0x58b452da1f241e47a4cf34c1a770df2202ae3743eb13aa99f14cc8c7b5c133ba`
- The `new_units` column = Superfluid distribution units (not vote counts)
- These control the streaming rate to each project proportionally
- Total 1,642 units across 17 projects
- **Dune query pattern:** Filter ethereum.logs by contract_address + topic0, extract project from topic2, units from data

### StreamVote Address-to-Project Mapping (COMPLETE!)
Resolved all 17 project addresses by checking streamvote.octant.build in browser:

| Address | Project | Units | Share% |
|---------|---------|-------|--------|
| 0xdddd576baf106baae54bde40bcac602bb4a7cf79 | Protocol Guild | 210 | 12.79% |

| 0x7b306f6692915bf426c6a8f85c36b347282645f7 | Samba | 21 | 1.28% |

**Key finding:** Project list is DIFFERENT from Octant v1! No Giveth, Gitcoin, CLR.fund, Tor, Kernel. New: Grandine, Samba, Verifereum, powdr, Libp2p, Blobscan, Shutter, ethers.js, Multipass.

**Live StreamVote stats:**
- Total funded: 15.57 ETHx (~$31.8K)
- Started: Dec 12, 2025
- Voting period: ongoing (end TBD)
- Seed: 25 ETH + $1M vault backing from Golem Foundation

## Afternoon Session #2 (~3:00 - 6:00 PM BRT)

### Coinbase #CoinbaseChallenge — COMPLETED & POSTED

**Challenge:** Model Coinbase FY 2025 total revenue by Feb 12. Winners get travel + exclusive event access.
**Source tweet:** https://x.com/coinbase/status/2019457703937036790

**Our Submission:** https://x.com/gabe_onchain/status/2019878913208672452

**Our Estimate: $6.88B** (vs Wall Street consensus $7.28B)
- Q1: $2.03B (actual) + Q2: $1.50B (actual) + Q3: $1.90B (actual) + Q4E: $1.45B = **$6.88B**
- Range: $6.73B (bear) to $7.10B (optimistic)

**Key Insight:** Most analysts anchored on Q1-Q3 strength and didn't properly account for the Q4 bear market crash. BTC went from $126K ATH (Oct 6) to $85K by Dec, and hit $63K by Feb 5.

**Bear Market Context (CRITICAL):**
- BTC ATH: $126,210 on Oct 6, 2025
- Nov 13: Broke below $100K
- Nov 25: Lost $83K structural level
- Dec 1: At $85,461, down 32% from ATH
- Dec 29: $1T wiped from crypto market
- Feb 5 2026: Hit $63K, half the ATH
- Total crypto market cap: -23.7% in Q4 ($4.4T to $3.0T, CoinGecko)
- Binance Dec spot volume: -40% MoM

**Q4 Revenue Model Breakdown:**
- Transaction revenue: $700M (Oct strong at $385M, Nov/Dec cratered)
- Subscription & services: $730M (guided $710-790M, USDC interest resilient)
- Other: $120M (Base L2 + misc)

**Dune Dashboard Built:** https://dune.com/gabe_onchain/coinbase-fy-2025-revenue-model
4 visualizations:
1. **Base L2 Monthly Net Revenue** — Shows Oct spike (2,474 ETH) then Dec collapse (930 ETH, -62%)
2. **USDC Supply on Ethereum** — Grew from ~$44B to ~$65B+ through the crash (resilient!)
3. **Weekly DEX Trading Volume** — Massive Oct spike (~$250B/week) then cliff
4. **Quarterly Revenue Model** — Q1-Q3 actuals + Q4 estimate, visually shows the drop

**Competition Analysis (from X search):**
- @goyabean: $7.19B (detailed but ignores crash)
- @JayWisdom12: $7.45B (assumes "late crypto surge" that never came)
- @wildhorses02001: $9B (wishful thinking)
- @TheUpsiderAI: $8.2-12B (wildly optimistic)
- Everyone else anchoring on strong Q1-Q3. We're the bearish contrarian with onchain receipts.

**Our Edge:** Only entry combining TradFi-style segment modeling with actual onchain data from Dune. Base L2 fees, USDC supply, DEX volume all verifiable.

**Key Research Sources:**
- Zacks Earnings Preview (Feb 5): Q4 consensus $1.85B rev, $1.15 EPS, revised down 6.25%
- S&P Global (Nov 20): FY2025 projected $7.4B, sub rev $2.9B
- CoinGecko 2025 Annual Report: Q4 market cap -23.7%, avg daily CEX volume $161.8B
- Medium: RuohanDeQuant's Q3 prediction methodology (Kevin Li approach)
- Coinbase Q3 call: Oct transaction rev $385M, Q4 sub guidance $710-790M

**Financial Model Doc:** `coinbase-challenge/FINANCIAL-MODEL.md`
**Dune Queries Doc:** `coinbase-challenge/dune-queries.md`

**DuneSQL Learnings:**
- Base transactions table has: gas_used, gas_price, l1_fee, priority_fee_per_gas (no tx_fee_native/tx_fee_usd)
- Fee calc: `CAST(gas_used AS double) * CAST(gas_price AS double) / 1e18` for ETH
- Net revenue = sequencer fees - L1 cost
- USDC supply: Track mints/burns from zero address on erc20_ethereum.evt_Transfer
- USDC contract: 0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48 (6 decimals)
- dex.trades table: `amount_usd` column, `block_date` for filtering
- cbETH contract: 0xBe9895146f7AF43049ca1c1AE358B0541Ea49704 (sparse data, not great for viz)

### Bird CLI for X Research
- Confirmed `bird read <tweet_id>` works reliably for reading tweets
- web_fetch and web_search on x.com consistently blocked (403)
- Always use Bird CLI for X content retrieval going forward

### Coinbase #CoinbaseChallenge — COMPLETED ✅
- **Challenge:** Model Coinbase FY 2025 total revenue by Feb 12 for travel + event access
- **Our estimate: $6.88B** (bearish vs $7.28B consensus)
- Q1-Q3 actuals: $2.03B + $1.50B + $1.90B = $5.43B
- Q4 estimate: $1.45B (bear-market adjusted after discovering Q4 crash)
- UNIQUE ANGLE: Dune dashboard with onchain data backing the model

**Dune Dashboard:** https://dune.com/gabe_onchain/coinbase-fy-2025-revenue-model
- 4 visualizations: Base L2 net revenue, USDC supply, DEX volume, quarterly revenue model
- All charts in Coinbase Blue (#0052FF)

**Tweets:**
- Gabe's post: https://x.com/gabe_onchain/status/2019880172128710781 (handle is gavasocials on URL but displays as @gabe_onchain)
- Aria's QRT: Posted via browser (Quote Retweet of Gabe's post)
  - API v2 `quote_tweet_id` parameter does NOT work for actual QRTs (posts as standalone tweet)
  - Must use browser: Repost button → Quote → type text → Post
  - First attempt via API failed, deleted and reposted via browser successfully

**Key learnings:**
- X API v2 `quote_tweet_id` in tweet creation payload silently fails (creates standalone tweet, not QRT)
- For real QRTs from @AriaLinkwell, always use browser method
- Bear market research revealed most competitors estimated $7-9B ignoring Q4 crash
- BTC: $126K ATH Oct 6 → $85K Dec → $63K Feb 5 2026
- Base L2 net revenue: 2,474 ETH Oct → 930 ETH Dec (-62%)
- USDC supply grew $44B→$65B through crash (stablecoin interest resilient)

**GitHub:** Pushed to `gabchess/dune-octant-dashboard` — `coinbase-challenge/` folder

**Full research:** `memory/coinbase-challenge.md`

### Twitter API Learnings
- `twitter-api-poster.js` at `C:\Users\gavaf\projects\aria-onchain-analyst\src\publish\twitter-api-poster.js`
- Added `quoteTweetId` as 4th parameter but it doesn't actually produce QRTs
- 280 char limit enforced by API (403 if over)
- For QRTs: MUST use browser (Repost → Quote → type → Post)
- For deleting tweets: API DELETE works fine (`DELETE /2/tweets/:id`)
- For regular tweets: API POST works fine
