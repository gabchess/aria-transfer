- ETFs are NET SELLERS in 2026 (bought 46K BTC same time last year)

## Gabe's Plan
- Budget: 10K reais (~$2K USD)
- Strategy: DCA R$500/week (5 weeks)
- If BTC < $65K: bump to R$750/week
- If BTC < $60K: go heavier
- Don't try to time the bottom — DCA is the play

## Additional Research — Feb 10

### Macro Tailwinds (@0x_cos analysis)
- 190+ public companies hold ~974K BTC, didn't sell during crash — structural demand floor
- Fed at 3.50-3.75%, two more cuts priced in 2026 — easing = BTC tailwind
- Gold showed same multiplier compression (24x → 7.5x → 5.3x) before hitting ATH $5,500
- 10x cycles probably over, but orderly compression ≠ death. BTC is maturing like gold did.

### DCA vs Lump Sum (@SuperBoring_xyz)
- BTC topped $126K Oct 2025, fell to $60-70K (40-50% drawdown)
- DCA wins in volatile markets because it maximizes SURVIVABILITY
- You never have entire position underwater at once
- Core truth: "The winning strategy isn't being early. It's staying in the game."

### Updated Conviction
Our R$500/week DCA plan is validated by both analyses. Macro setup (rate cuts + institutional holding) = buying a maturing asset during a bear dip. Stay consistent, don't try to time.
