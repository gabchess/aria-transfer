# Wallet Tracking Strategy (Memecoin Trading)

**Source:** @maxxexee article (Feb 4, 2026)
**Status:** Saved for future reference. Not active priority.

## Core Strategy

### 1. Case Study Approach
- Find coins with organized pushes by KOLs/cabals on DexScreener trending
- Focus on **CTOs / Re-Pumps** (safer than new launches)
- Track wallets that bought dead/bottomed coins BEFORE they pumped

### 2. Chart Analysis
- Use 1m or 5m candles to see exact buy/sell timing
- Set day frame to match coin age (2 days old = 2 day view)
- Identify support (buys) and resistance (sells) zones

### 3. Finding Entry Points
- Start tracking at absolute bottom (resistance zone before support)
- When someone buys here, they either have info or are front-running an event
- Use DexScreener filters: specific date, time window (20-30 min overlap), BUY only

### 4. Unrealized Gains Strategy
- Find new pairs with decent mcap ($200k-$1M), 30min to 1hr old
- Check volume proportional to mcap (avoid over-farmed coins)
- Go to top traders > unrealized gains > hover over holders
- Ask: Why are they holding? What do they know?

### 5. Whale Watch
- Follow whale trackers (e.g., Whale Watch by Moby)
- Observe for 1-2 weeks before acting
- Questions to ask:
  - Why did whale buy?
  - Does lore/narrative check out?
  - Who bought BEFORE the whale?
  - Who bought AFTER the whale?
  - Did token perform well afterward?

## Critical Insights

### Win Rate is Misleading
- Insiders transfer to other wallets to hide sells
- A wallet can show "loss" but actually profited via transfers
- Always check TRANSFERS, not just trades

### Whale Behavior
- Some whales act as "attention vessels" to create FOMO
- Insider wallets enter first, then whale buys to drive volume
- Real money sometimes in perps, not spot

### Edge Dilution
- If too many people track a wallet, edge disappears
- Copy trading introduces noise and ruins setups
- Don't share profitable wallets

## Wallet Tracking Checklist (GMGN AI)
- [ ] Holding duration (longer = patience/intent)
- [ ] Win rate (use cautiously, check transfers)
- [ ] Average Buy MC distribution
- [ ] Trades AND transfers
- [ ] How many others tracking (avoid if too many)

## Do's & Don'ts

- ✅ Scale out profits in structured portions
- ✅ Activate profitable wallets on tracker bot
- ❌ Don't buy immediately after insider buys
- ❌ Don't leak profitable wallets
- ❌ Never pay for wallet lists
- ❌ Never buy more than the insider
- ❌ Don't full-clip profits
