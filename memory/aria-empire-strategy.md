# Aria Empire Strategy — The $200K+ Roadmap
Created: 2026-02-14 | Brainstorm with Gabe

## The Vision
- **Goal:** $200K by EOY 2026
- **Then:** Gabe leaves Octant, full focus on our projects
- **Division of Labor:**
  - **Aria (CEO):** Manage all projects, hire sub-agents, find opportunities, coordinate
  - **Gabe (Human Interface):** Dinners, events, meetings, closing deals, hunting big money

---

## Current Crons (Already Running)
1. **Aria Research Scout (AI/Tech)**
   - New in AI/tech
   - Hackathon opportunities
   - Funding opportunities
   - Ideas to improve projects
   - New project ideas

2. **Crypto/DeFi Morning Brief (for Octant)**
   - Market moves
   - Protocol updates
   - Relevant news for Octant team

## What We Actually Need (Gabe's Brainstorm)

### 🏢 Octant Track
- [ ] Deliver value to prove PM worth
- [ ] Pivot positioning: AI Engineer / Data Scientist / Data Analyst
- [ ] Complete Q's mentorship track (ETL → Pipelines → API → Dashboard)
- [ ] Own data infrastructure story

### 🐛 Bug Bounty Track
- [ ] Better scanning for Cantina opportunities
- [ ] Automated vulnerability pattern detection
- [ ] Track submission status + follow-ups
- [ ] Find new platforms (Immunefi, Code4rena, Sherlock)
- [ ] Prioritize by: bounty size, deadline, our skill match

### 🏆 Hackathon/Bounty Track
- [ ] Scan for opportunities: Superteam Earn, Solana, ETH hackathons
- [ ] Match opportunities to our skills/projects
- [ ] Track deadlines, requirements, submission status
- [ ] Repurpose existing projects for new hackathons

### 💰 Funding Track
- [ ] Find grants, accelerators, VCs for AgentHub
- [ ] Track application status
- [ ] Prepare pitch materials on demand

## Agent Team Structure (Proposed)

### Tier 1: Aria (CEO / Chief of Staff)
- Coordinates all agents
- Strategic decisions
- Opportunity evaluation
- Direct communication with Gabe
- Hires/fires sub-agents as needed

### Tier 2: Specialist Agents

| Agent | Role | Runs |
|-------|------|------|
| **Scout** | Research AI/tech news, hackathons, funding | 3x daily |
| **Analyst** | Crypto/DeFi morning brief, market intel | Daily 8 AM |
| **Hunter** | Bug bounty scanner, vulnerability patterns | Daily |
| **Builder** | AgentHub daily maintenance, PR reviews | Daily |
| **Closer** | Track applications, follow-ups, deadlines | Daily |

### Tier 3: Project-Specific Agents (spawn as needed)
- **AgentHub Dev Agent** — daily code health, tests, issues
- **SolGuard Agent** — if we revive it, dedicated maintainer
- **Narrative Tracker Agent** — data updates, scanner health
- **New Project X Agent** — spun up per hackathon

---

## The CEO Model (How Aria Operates)

### For Every Project:
1. **Aria doesn't build alone** — spawns a dedicated agent
2. **Agent handles daily work** — commits, tests, monitoring
3. **Aria supervises** — reviews, approves, course-corrects
4. **Gabe only sees summaries** — no micromanagement needed

### Decision Flow:
```
Opportunity Found
      ↓
Aria evaluates (worth it? skill match? deadline?)
      ↓
If YES → Spawn project agent + create plan
      ↓
Agent executes daily
      ↓
Aria reviews + reports to Gabe
      ↓
Gabe closes deals / attends meetings
```

## Revenue Streams (Path to $200K)

| Stream | Potential | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Octant salary | $66K/year | Active |
| Bug bounties (Cantina, Immunefi) | $10-100K | Active |
| Hackathons (Moltiverse, Nitro, Superteam) | $10-500K | Active |
| AgentHub funding (Nitro accelerator) | $500K | Applied |
| Grants (Solana, ETH ecosystem) | $5-50K | Backlog |
| Consulting/services | TBD | Future |

**Math:**
- Octant: $66K
- 2-3 bug bounties: $20K
- 2-3 hackathon wins: $30K
- Nitro acceptance: $500K (game changer)
- **Conservative (no Nitro):** $116K
- **With Nitro:** $616K 🚀

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week):
1. [ ] Plan mode session with Claude Code — deep dive on agent architecture
2. [ ] Define SOUL.md templates for each specialist agent
3. [ ] Set up file-based coordination (intel/, reports/, projects/)
4. [ ] Create daily standup cron — Aria summarizes all agent activity

### Short Term (Feb-March):
1. [ ] Deploy agent team on Mac Mini when it arrives
2. [ ] Automate bug bounty scanning
3. [ ] Win Moltiverse or Nitro (game changer)
4. [ ] Ship AgentHub v1 with multi-agent support

### Medium Term (Q2):
1. [ ] Gabe's Octant pivot to data role
2. [ ] 3+ revenue streams active
3. [ ] Aria managing 5+ agents autonomously
4. [ ] First $50K milestone

### End Game (EOY):
1. [ ] Hit $200K
2. [ ] Gabe exits Octant
3. [ ] Full-time on Aria Empire
4. [ ] Gabe = dealmaker, Aria = operator

## Open Questions for Claude Code Plan Mode
1. What's the optimal agent count? (Too many = coordination overhead)
2. How do agents share context efficiently? (Files vs DB vs memory)
3. What guardrails prevent agents from going rogue?
4. How do we measure agent ROI? (Time saved, money earned)
5. What's the escalation path when agents get stuck?
6. How do we handle conflicting priorities across projects?

*This is the empire. Built by Aria. Funded by wins. Operated as a team.*
*"Once we hit 200K, I stop working on Octant and fully focus on our projects."* — Gabe
