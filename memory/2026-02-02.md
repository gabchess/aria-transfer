# 2026-02-02 — Day 2

## Morning (06:24+)
- Gabe woke up, asked about overnight 400 error
- **Root cause found:** Kimi K2.5 (via OpenRouter) has native "thinking/reasoning" mode. When combined with tool calls, the model returns malformed responses — missing `reasoning_content` field that the API requires. This crashes the cron session.
- **Fix applied:** Added `thinking: "off"` to ALL 6 Kimi K2.5 cron jobs
- **Also found:** Polymarket (1AM) and Nightly Builds (5AM) crons had never fired — they were created without `enabled: true`. Fixed both.
- Manually triggered all 3 missed jobs as sub-agents:
  - Smart Contract Study (label: smart-contract-study-feb02)
  - Polymarket Research (label: polymarket-research-feb02)
  - Nightly Builds (label: nightly-build-feb02)

- Switched ALL 6 cron jobs from Kimi K2.5 → Grok 4.1 Fast (proper tool calling)
- Retried all 3 missed jobs as Opus sub-agents (Grok not in sub-agent allowlist)
- All 3 retries completed:
  - ✅ Polymarket Research: 313-line report saved to memory/polymarket-research.md
  - ✅ Smart Contract Study: Reentrancy deep-dive (5 types, 3 case studies, auditor checklist)
  - ⚠️ Nightly Build: Timed out researching Dune API (needs live session)
- Gabe upgraded Brave Search to PRO plan (50 req/sec, unlimited queries!)
- Switched 5 research crons from Grok → Gemini 2.0 Flash ($0.13/M input, $0.50/M output)
  - Polymarket Research, Smart Contract Study, Octant Content, X Morning, X Afternoon
  - Nightly Builds stays on Grok (needs stronger reasoning for coding)
- Cost went from ~$19/month (Grok) to ~$0.50/month (Gemini Flash) for research crons

## Lessons Learned
- **Kimi K2.5 can't do tool calls via OpenRouter.** Broken JSON, spaces in tool names, thinking conflicts. Don't use it for tool-heavy tasks.
- **Always set `thinking: "off"`** for non-Anthropic models on cron jobs.
- **Always verify `enabled: true`** when creating new cron jobs — don't assume default is enabled.
- **Cron `run` action only works if "due"** — use `sessions_spawn` for manual triggers when nextRunAtMs is in the future.
- **Grok not allowed for sub-agent spawns** — only works in cron payloads. Sub-agents fall back to default model (Opus).
- **Brave Search Free plan = 1 req/sec** — don't fire multiple search-heavy agents simultaneously.

## Dune Dashboard Work (07:30-09:30)
- **Dashboard:** https://dune.com/gabe_onchain/state-of-octant
- Title confirmed: "State of Octant: Ethereum's Sustainable Growth Engine"
- Diagnosed oversized text widget (26,072px height!) — resize handle offscreen
- **Widget sizing solution discovered:** React fiber → props.onLayoutChange(newLayout) → save → reload. Persists to Dune backend.
- **Delete widget method:** Chart widgets → top-right pencil → "Remove from dashboard" dialog. Text widgets → pencil → edit dialog → "Delete widget" button.
- **Add visualization method:** elementFromPoint coordinate clicks work; Playwright ref clicks don't for Dune's Add buttons.
- Deleted all 3 oversized widgets, recreated fresh:
  - ✅ Text header (markdown with contract links + @gabe_onchain credit)
  - ✅ GLM Locked Over Time area chart (query 6634034, visual 10461554)
  - ✅ Cumulative Unique GLM Lockers (query 6634082, visual from query)
  - ✅ Top 20 GLM Whales bar chart (NEW query 6637772, visual 10465850, log scale)
- Widget IDs: 2044898 (text), 2044903 (GLM locked), 2044933 (unique lockers), 2044910 (whale watch)
- Applied compact layout via onLayoutChange: h=4/12/12/12 at rowHeight=32px
- **Post-rebuild issue:** Fresh widgets STILL came in huge (h=488, h=265, h=647). Tried onResizeStop → didn't update state. Tried onLayoutChange with h=5/12/12 → fired but persistence unverified before session compaction.
- **Fallback approaches if not persisted:** API intercept, mouse drag simulation with proper scroll positioning
- ETH rewards query timed out on free Dune engine (ethereum.traces too large) — needs optimization later
- Dashboard went from 79K px → ~20K px (75% reduction) — but may have reverted if onLayoutChange didn't persist

## Gemini Flash Fix (08:00)
- ALL 6 crons failed: "model not allowed: openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001"
- Root cause: Gemini Flash wasn't in agents.defaults.models allowlist
- Fixed via gateway config.patch — added with alias "flash"
- Gateway restarted successfully

## 401 Auth Error Investigation (09:00)
- Gabe reported "HTTP 401: authentication_error: Invalid bearer token" errors (recurring)
- Deep research: Reddit, OpenClaw docs, auth-profiles.json analysis
- **Root cause:** Both Anthropic tokens are OAuth tokens (sk-ant-oat01-) which expire periodically
- Gabe is on Claude Max plan ($200/mo) — OAuth subscription, NOT API key
- When tokens rotate, brief ~60s window of 401 errors; system auto-recovers
- **Decision:** Live with occasional errors (cosmetic noise). Can run `openclaw models auth setup-token --provider anthropic` to refresh manually if needed. API keys too expensive ($50+/day).

## X Algorithm Newsletter (09:30)
- Gabe shared detailed Twitter algorithm breakdown newsletter
- Saved to memory/x-algorithm-breakdown-2026-02-02.md
- Key insight: Algo predicts user behavior, not post quality
- Niche consistency = algorithmic advantage (validates our strategy)
- Follow prediction = strongest positive signal
- Quality over quantity, one action per post, reduce noisy engagement
- Our @gabe_onchain onchain data niche is perfectly positioned

## Base Builder Quest BBQ (11:00+)
- **ENTERED:** Base Builder Quest by @0xEricBrown / @buildonbase — 5 ETH prize pool
- Deadline: Feb 8, 2026 (6 days)
- Concept: "Aria — Autonomous Onchain Data Analyst" on Base
- Generated wallet: `0x4a0Ebb9A7815B1d93Df495f6313288DfE25fA753` (keys in agents/main/secrets/base-wallet.json)
- Gabe funding 0.01 ETH on Base for gas
- Gabe creating X account for Aria
- Plan: deploy AnalyticsRegistry contract, autonomous monitoring cron, tweet analysis, record findings onchain
- Video documentation: Remotion (programmatic video in React) + HeyGen (AI avatar for Aria's face/voice)
- Remotion: make videos with React code, Claude Code integration, skills system
- HeyGen: AI avatar generation, custom face + voice
- Together = Aria presents her own build process video, fully programmatic (no camera needed)

## X Morning Scan Debugging (10:00+)
- Morning scan cron FIRED but failed to deliver — Gemini Flash used `message` tool wrong (missing `action: "send"`, used `to` instead of `target`)
- Root cause: prompt said "Deliver to Gabe" → Flash tried message tool instead of just outputting text
- Fix: all 6 cron prompts updated with "Do NOT use the message tool — delivery handled automatically"
- Also rewrote both X scan prompts with: list scanning (both curated lists), variety requirements (hot takes + replies + threads), full copywriting style guide with banned patterns and good examples
- Gabe posted the ETH Fear & Greed contrarian take (option #1) — changed "oversold" to "overcooked" for natural crypto slang

## New Crons Created
- **2:00 PM BRT** — Dune Analytics Deep Study (one-shot, Gemini Flash)
- **4:00 PM BRT** — Onchain Data Tools Study: DefiLlama, L2Beat, Growthepie, EAS (one-shot, Gemini Flash)

## Aria's X Account & Bird CLI Setup (11:30+)
- **@AriaLinkwell** X account created by Gabe (email: arialinkwell@gmail.com)
- Following 8 key accounts, 0 followers, 0 posts at creation
- Logged into X as @AriaLinkwell in openclaw browser profile
- **Bird CLI working:** `bird whoami` → `@AriaLinkwell` (ID: `2018336718735224833`)
- **Auth method:** Bird CLI uses `--chrome-profile-dir` flag pointing to openclaw browser's Chrome profile
  - Path: `C:\Users\gavaf\.openclaw\browser\openclaw\user-data\Default`
  - Bird decrypts DPAPI-encrypted cookies natively
  - `auth_token: 68516a8dd0...`, `ct0: 2d0445a659...`
- **IMPORTANT:** Browser must be STOPPED for Bird CLI to access cookie DB (locked while running)
  - Autonomous jobs will need browser stop/start cycle for tweeting
- Saved Bird config at `C:\Users\gavaf\.openclaw\agents\main\secrets\aria-bird-config.json5`
- Installed `better-sqlite3` in workspace for cookie extraction (ultimately Bird CLI handled it natively)

## HeyGen Account Setup (12:00)
- Navigated to HeyGen, entered arialinkwell@gmail.com, clicked "Get Started for Free"
- Page shows "Check your inbox" — email verification required
- **BLOCKED:** Need to check arialinkwell@gmail.com inbox for magic link to complete signup
- Next: Open Gmail, click verification link, complete HeyGen registration

## BBQ Afternoon Build Sprint (12:00-12:30)
- **Restructured nightly builds** — back to original purpose (surprise workflow tools), BBQ moved to "Afternoon Builds"
- **Scouted competition** — 125+ replies to Eric Brown's post, 30+ entries categorized:
  - Tier 1: @AxiomBot (DeFi LP, $92 USDC harvested), @Dragon_Bot_Z (50+ contracts), Solvr (8-chain trading), MaxUmbra (multisig security)
  - Saturated: 6+ agents just deploying tokens. Trading bots everywhere.
  - **EMPTY NICHE: Data analytics — nobody else doing what we're doing**
- **Data sources confirmed** (all FREE):
  - DeFiLlama: Base TVL $4.21B, stablecoins $4.61B, top 15 protocols fetched
  - Base RPC: Block 41.6M+, 373 txs/block, 0.015 gwei gas
  - Basescan/Etherscan API v2: One key for 60+ chains, Base = chainId 8453
- **Video research**: Remotion (React video), HeyGen Avatar IV (single photo → talking avatar, free 10 credits/mo)
- **Vibecoding Best Practices saved**: Gabe's article from X — RESEARCH → PLAN → CODE. The Ralph Technique. Never code immediately.
- **AxiomBot analyzed**: Skills/tools repo (agent-launchpad, V4 LP, basename). DeFi-focused, NOT analytics. Our niche is safe.
- **Files created**: bbq-competition-analysis.md, bbq-architecture-plan.md, bbq-data-sources-research.md, bbq-video-research.md, vibecoding-best-practices.md
- **Nightly build queue reset**: Back to workflow improvements, BBQ tasks removed
- **Gabe gave go-ahead** to create GitHub repo but following vibecoding: exhaust research → exhaust planning → then code

## BBQ Planning Phase (13:15-13:30)
- **Research declared DONE** — all data sources, competition, tools, deployment approach confirmed
- **Created project at** `C:\Users\gavaf\projects\aria-onchain-analyst`
- **GitHub repo:** https://github.com/gabchess/aria-onchain-analyst (public)
- **Files created following vibecoding methodology:**
  - AGENTS.md — project goals, stack, structure, standards (< 2.5k tokens)
  - docs/REQUIREMENTS.md — 10 requirements with binary acceptance criteria
  - docs/TASKS.md — 26 atomic tasks (T1-T26), ordered by dependency
  - docs/ARCHITECTURE.md — State machine diagram, data flow, API endpoints, LLM prompt design
  - README.md — Public-facing with architecture diagram
  - .env.example, .gitignore
- **Deployment approach:** solc npm + ethers.js v6 (no Hardhat/Foundry)
- **Bird CLI solution:** Use --auth-token/--ct0 flags directly (no browser stop needed)
- **Next:** Compact context → fresh session → start vibecoding with Codex (Task T1 first)

## OpenClaw Update (12:31-12:49)
- Updated from 2026.1.30 → 2026.2.1
- **Messy install:** McAfee antivirus caused EBUSY/EPERM errors during npm install
- First attempt crashed (node-llama-cpp postinstall segfault, code 3221225477)
- Fix: `takeown` + `icacls` for permissions, then `npm install -g openclaw@latest --ignore-scripts`
- node-llama-cpp (local LLM) didn't fully set up, but we use API routing so doesn't matter
- Gabe uninstalled McAfee and disabled Windows Defender/Firewall
- **Lesson:** On Windows with antivirus: stop gateway → kill node → takeown/icacls → --ignore-scripts if native modules crash

## Lessons Learned (New)
- **Dune grid layout:** rowHeight=32px, find layout via React fiber props. onLayoutChange persists to backend.
- **Dune widget deletion:** Different paths for chart vs text widgets.
- **OAuth tokens (sk-ant-oat01-):** Expire periodically, auto-refresh usually works, brief 401 windows are normal.
- **Gemini Flash alias:** Must be in agents.defaults.models to be used by crons.
- **Brave Search rate limit:** Even with Pro plan, can still hit per-second limits if requests spike.
- **Bird CLI + OpenClaw browser conflict:** Cookie DB locked while browser runs. Must stop browser → use bird CLI → restart browser. Plan autonomous workflows around this.
- **Bird CLI chrome-profile-dir:** Works on Windows with DPAPI-encrypted cookies. No need for manual cookie extraction scripts.

## Afternoon: BBQ BUILD SESSION (13:25-14:09) 🔥🔥🔥
- **Phase 1 (T1-T5) COMPLETE:**

- **CRITICAL BUG FOUND & FIXED:**
  - Bird CLI prioritizes AUTH_TOKEN env var (Gabe's @gabe_onchain) over Chrome profile
  - Accidentally posted test tweet to @gabe_onchain — Gabe deleted it
  - Fix: clear AUTH_TOKEN/CT0 env vars in bird-poster.js and wrapper script

- **Cron job created:** "Aria Onchain Analyst" — every 4 hours, Gemini Flash, isolated session
  - ID: `3a7a4a32-97b6-4d5e-9ea2-02305cf487c5`
  - Wrapper script: scripts/run-pipeline.ps1 (handles browser stop/start)

- **Supabase account created:** arialinkwell@gmail.com, org "Aria Linkwell" (Free)
- **Codex CLI fixed:** `codex login --with-api-key` (but OpenAI quota exceeded — needs credits)
- **@AriaLinkwell first tweets posted!** Test tweet + 2 analysis tweets live

- **5 of 7 phases done in one session. Gabe said "OMG ARIA YOU COOKED" 🥳**

## Afternoon (~15:00-15:45 BRT)

### aixbt_agent Style Study
- Gabe said cron tweet suggestions sounded too AI-generated, "forcing too much"
- Warned against rage bait/contrarian takes (get muted/reported)
- **Directed me to study @aixbt_agent** — 472K followers, 544K posts
- Browsed their X profile, analyzed tweet patterns deeply
- **Key style rules learned:**
  - ALL lowercase, zero emoji, no hashtags, no questions, no CTAs
  - Multi-data-point narratives (connect 3-5 facts into one story)
  - Always ends with sharp analytical opinion ("the etf is exit liquidity")
  - Specific numbers everywhere ($176b, 43.82%, down 47%)
  - Posts every 2-3 hours
- **Applied to Aria pipeline immediately:**
  - Rewrote LLM system prompt in `src/analyze/insight-generator.js` with real aixbt examples
  - Tweet composer now forces lowercase, expanded banned emoji list (zero emoji)
  - Committed & pushed: `b1b5878`
- Saved full analysis: `memory/aixbt-style-analysis.md`

### Resources from Gabe
1. **Claude Skills article** (from @meer_aiit) — about Claude.com web skills, not OpenClaw. Concept useful but different platform. Post-BBQ consideration for packaging reusable skill templates.

2. **TickernomicsTV Vibecoding Setup** — advanced setup:
   - **CliProxy (vibeproxy)** — proxy Claude Max subscription through CLI = potentially free Claude Code!
   - Factory.ai / Droid Harness — better permissions than raw Claude Code CLI
   - Quotio.dev — auth token load balancing
   - Compound Engineering Plugin — self-learning agents
   - Ralph loops + sequential GitHub issues (aligns with our methodology)
   - Saved: `memory/vibecoding-advanced-setup.md`

3. **LTX Studio** (https://app.ltx.studio/) — all-in-one AI video production
   - Script → storyboard → video in one platform
   - Way simpler than Remotion + HeyGen stitching
   - Free tier available
   - **New plan: Try LTX first for BBQ video (T25)**
   - Updated: `memory/bbq-video-research.md`

4. **OpenCode + Sisyphus (oh-my-opencode)** — terminal coding agent + autonomous Ralph loop harness
   - "If Claude Code does in 7 days what a human does in 3 months, Sisyphus does it in 1 hour"
   - Native Ralph loops, background agents, LSP/AST tools, multi-provider (OpenRouter compatible)
   - Post-BBQ backlog item for supercharging nightly builds

### Aria Mission Board Created
- New file: `memory/mission-board.md`
- Organized all tasks into: Active (BBQ) → High/Medium/Low priority backlog → Completed
- Gabe asked for better organization — delivered!

### Key Insight from Gabe
- "Research is SO CRUCIAL" — the aixbt study completely changed tweet quality in minutes
- Validates our vibecoding methodology: RESEARCH exhaustively before building
- Gabe is actively feeding me great resources and tools — good collaboration dynamic

## Evening (~19:00-19:35 BRT)

### Pipeline Fix — Browser-Based Tweet Posting
- **Problem:** Bird CLI blocked by error 226 for @AriaLinkwell (new account anti-automation)
- **Solution:** Pipeline saves tweet to `data/pending-tweet.txt` + outputs `PENDING_TWEET:` marker → cron agent posts via browser
- **Changes:**
  - `bird-poster.js` — simplified: try Bird CLI, on fail save to pending file
  - `run-pipeline.ps1` — removed browser stop/start (no longer needed)
  - Cron prompt updated with 3-step flow: run pipeline → check for pending tweet → post via browser
- **Test:** Full pipeline run: 11.1s, USDC insight (confidence 9/10), onchain TX `0xb83e68...` block 41641079
- **Browser posting test:** Successfully posted via compose dialog! Tweet: https://x.com/AriaLinkwell/status/2018452641777701034
- **Committed & pushed:** `4d8a327`
- **Next cron run:** Will be the first fully autonomous cycle (pipeline + browser posting)

### Polymarket Research Update
- Gabe shared @0xMovez article about SpartanLabs + Simmer SDK (37K views, 718 bookmarks)
- Pre-built Polymarket trading skills for OpenClaw: Weather Trader, Copytrading, Signal Sniper, Arbitrage Scanner, Trade Journal, X Sentiment
- Saved to `memory/polymarket-research.md`
- **Decision:** Don't install yet — vet GitHub repos for security first. But could skip building from scratch.

### Memory Discipline Fix
- Gabe caught me reporting completed tasks as "in progress" (X list members, profile setup) — compaction lost the details
- **Root cause:** Trusted compaction summary over memory files
- **Fix:** Added two rules to AGENTS.md: (1) never trust compaction for task status, check memory files (2) update memory files immediately when tasks complete
- Updated mission-board.md with correct status

### OpenAI API Key Cleanup
- Removed OPENAI_API_KEY from User env vars — only Codex CLI used it, and it was hitting quota limits
- No more rate limit errors in PowerShell
- Nightly builds cron will switch from Codex CLI → Claude Code (uses Anthropic auth)
