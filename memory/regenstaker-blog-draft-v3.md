# From Epochs to Forevers. Welcome to the Octant App.

*Draft v3 — Feb 13, 2026*
*~550 words | Style: Octant STATE.md applied | Merges Gabe draft + Ben draft*

---

Over the past 2.5 years, thousands of you have participated in our Octant v1 Epochs. Together you've pushed millions of dollars in matching funding toward the projects and causes that matter most to you. All of it on a 90-day clock.

That clock served us well through 10 epochs. But we kept hearing the same thing from our community.

"Why can't I just stake when I'm ready?"

Fair question. Let's get into it.

## How staking works today

Quick crash course. An epoch lasts roughly 90 days. You lock GLM, wait for the allocation window, decide which projects get funded, collect your ETH rewards, repeat.

Everyone operates on the same clock. Same start, same end. Straightforward and predictable.

But predictable comes with trade-offs. Lock your GLM on day 45? You're earning roughly half of what day-one stakers get. Miss the allocation window because life happened? Your rewards default away from the projects you wanted to support. The clock doesn't wait for you.

## What's changing

The Octant App removes the epoch calendar from staking entirely.

Stake your GLM whenever you want. Unstake whenever you want. Earn WETH rewards every second your tokens are in the contract. No 90-day cycles. No allocation windows to miss. No penalties for showing up late.

Rewards stream linearly over 30-day cycles. Your share is proportional to your stake relative to everyone else in the pool. No minimum. 1 GLM staked = 1 unit of earning power. Simple.

Think of it this way. Epochs were a bus schedule. The bus left every 90 days whether you were on it or not. The Octant App runs on your schedule.

## What stays the same

You're still locking GLM to earn individual rewards. Those rewards still represent your voting power in future Golem Foundation funding rounds. You can still claim and withdraw them whenever they've accrued.

You won't see a funding round on v2 for a few months. Until then, the app focuses on locking and rewards. But when rounds launch, this becomes your access point to everything: quadratic funding, community rounds, streaming experiments like StreamVote, all accessible from one application.

## Migrating from v1

Epoch 11 will be a Migration Epoch. Your goal is simple: move your GLM lock from v1 into v2. Three on-chain transactions.

1. Unlock your GLM from v1
2. Approve the token allowance
3. Lock into v2

Rewards start streaming the moment you migrate. Already have a v2 position? The migration increases your existing balance. One address, one position.

After the migration period, v1 moves toward sunset. You'll still be able to access v1 to withdraw, but GLM in v1 will no longer earn rewards.

## Why this matters beyond Golem

Here's the part that gets us excited.

This system is no longer specific to Golem Foundation. Any ecosystem or community can deploy the same infrastructure, set to function with their own tokens and their own funding parameters.

A DAO funding local builders. A protocol distributing grants to contributors. A community running preference votes on chain. Maybe this time next year, you'll be participating in multiple Octant v2 implementations across different ecosystems, proving that sustainable funding and high-quality preference aggregation can co-exist in web3 and beyond.

## Ready to migrate?

We'll share the exact timeline soon. When the Migration Epoch opens, head to the Octant App to move your GLM. Three transactions, a few minutes, and you're earning on your own terms.
