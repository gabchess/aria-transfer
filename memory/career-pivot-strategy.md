# Career Pivot Strategy — Data/AI Engineer Path
Created: 2026-02-14 | For next Octant meeting

## The Insight
From Q meeting (Feb 12): "400 ELO dev with 1600 ELO AI"
- Your DATA PARSING SCRIPT impressed Q more than any UI
- AI fluency is leverage, not weakness
- Most data engineers can't do what you do with AI

## Q's Growth Path for You
1. **ETL scripts** (Extract, Transform, Load) → JSON files ← YOU ARE HERE
2. **Pipelines** → Database that constantly updates
3. **API** → Expose data
4. **Dashboard** → Render on website

Keywords to learn: **pandas, ETL, pipelines, object-oriented programming**

## Your Unique Position
| Most Data Engineers | Most AI People | **YOU** |
|---------------------|----------------|---------|
| Strong ETL, SQL | Strong prompting | Both |
| Weak AI workflows | Weak data infra | Both |
| No crypto domain | No crypto domain | Deep crypto knowledge |

**You're at the intersection:** AI fluency + data skills + crypto domain expertise = rare combo.

## Proof of Work (for interviews/pitches)
- **AgentHub:** 6,800 LOC, traces → SQLite → API → Dashboard (this IS an ETL pipeline)
- **Octant metrics ETL:** Data parsing script Q loved
- **Narrative Tracker:** Supabase, crons, data pipelines
- **SolGuard:** Onchain analysis, wallet tracking
- **Octant Card:** Donor data parsing (the part Q valued most)

## Strategy Options

### Option A: Pivot WITHIN Octant
Shift from "Product Marketing" → "Data + Marketing"
- Complete RegenStaker blog + diagrams (proves technical translation skills)
- Build Donor Data Dashboard (Q's mentorship project)
- Pitch to Mashal: "I want to own our data infrastructure. Q is mentoring me."
- Your edge: ETL + pipelines + translate to marketing copy = rare

### Option B: External Roles
Target titles:
- AI Engineer (Agentic AI focus)
- Data Engineer (crypto/onchain focus)
- Analytics Engineer
- Onchain Data Analyst

### Option C: Hybrid (Recommended)
1. Stay at Octant, shift toward data role under Q
2. Complete Q's mentorship track
3. Build portfolio (Donor Dashboard, Dune dashboards)
4. In 3-6 months: promoted at Octant OR strong resume for external

## Key Articles Referenced
- "AI for Data Engineering" — AI pulled data engineers closer to decisions, not replaced them
- "AI Engineer Roadmap 2026" — 8-month path: Python → ML → Deep Learning → GenAI → Agentic AI
- Both emphasize: context, trade-offs, judgment, communication > raw technical skills

## Before Next Octant Meeting — Talking Points
1. "Q is mentoring me on data science. I want to go deeper."
2. "The AgentHub traces pipeline is essentially ETL → API → Dashboard"
3. "I can do data work AND translate it to marketing — that's my unique value"
4. "What's my next ETL project after donor dashboard?"

## Immediate Actions (Before Meeting)
- [ ] FINISH RegenStaker blog post + diagrams (overdue)
- [ ] Start pandas tutorials (Corey Schafer)
- [ ] Frame AgentHub as data engineering when talking to Q
- [ ] Prepare Donor Dashboard kickoff plan
