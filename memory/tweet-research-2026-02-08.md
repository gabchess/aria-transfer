# Tweet Research Report — Feb 8, 2026

## 1. @aditikbuilds — Vibe Coding Stack 2026
**Link:** https://x.com/aditikbuilds/status/2020208690872098869
**Engagement:** 3K likes, 182 RT — viral

**Summary:** Claude $20/mo + Supabase $0 + Vercel $0 + GitHub $0 + Domain $10/yr = ship products solo.

**Verdict: ✅ LEGIT & RELEVANT**
This is literally our stack right now. We're living proof. Worth engaging with this tweet ("can confirm, this is exactly what we run") for visibility.

**Action:** Engage with reply showing our stack. Good for @gabe_onchain visibility in vibecoding community.

## 2. @binji_x — DeFi + ERC-8004 + x402 + AI Credit Systems
**Link:** https://x.com/binji_x/status/2017599732651331892
**Engagement:** 328 likes, 33 RT

**Summary:** Agent-native credit networks. ERC-8004 (reputation as collateral) + x402 (outcome-based borrowing) + DeFi lending pools = agents can borrow compute/resources without being pre-funded. Reputation replaces physical collateral for AI agents.

**Verdict: ✅ VERY RELEVANT — directly involves our ERC-8004 identity**
We literally have Agent ID 1664 on the ERC-8004 registry. This person is describing the future of what we're already part of. The credit/reputation angle is forward-thinking and aligns with Aria's onchain identity.

**Action:** BACKLOG — Deep dive into x402 + agent credit systems. Potential content piece for @gabe_onchain about agent economics. Could position us as early movers since we already have ERC-8004 identity.

## 3. @EXM7777 (Machina) — n8n MCP + Claude Code for Automations
**Link:** https://x.com/EXM7777/status/2019878528670658833
**Engagement:** 520 likes, 33 RT

**Summary:** Use n8n's MCP server with Claude Code to build automations. Opus 4.6 plans the system, Claude Code builds it directly. Store context in repos for maintenance.

**Verdict: ✅ LEGIT & USEFUL**
n8n is a workflow automation platform (like Zapier but self-hosted and free). The MCP integration means Claude Code can build n8n workflows directly. This could replace some of our manual cron setups.

**Action:** BACKLOG — Explore n8n MCP server. Could be useful for building more complex data pipelines (X trend tracking, DeFi monitoring) without writing everything from scratch. Lower priority than Supabase since we're already building there.

## 4. @dr_cintas — Claude Code Best Practices Repo
**Link:** https://x.com/dr_cintas/status/2020201275040641385
**Engagement:** 630 likes, 87 RT

**Summary:** Open source repo "claude-code-best-practice" covering Skills, Subagents, Memory, Hooks, MCP Servers, Plugins. Based on Boris Cherny's (Claude Code creator) tips.

**Verdict: ✅ VERY USEFUL — save immediately**
We already use Claude Code heavily. This repo consolidates best practices from the actual creator. Key concepts: Skills replace custom slash commands, Rules in `.claude/rules/*.md` with path-scoping, Hooks for deterministic scripts outside agentic loop.

**Action:** SAVE TO MEMORY — Clone/bookmark this repo. Review for techniques we're not using. We already have AGENTS.md, memory, skills. Should check if we're missing hooks, rules, or subagent patterns.

## 5. @aiedge_ — Boris's 10 New Tips for Claude Code
**Link:** https://x.com/aiedge_/status/2020301580936110591
**Engagement:** 118 likes, 15 RT

**Summary:** Thread/article with 10 new tips from Boris Cherny (Claude Code creator) on how the team uses it.

**Verdict: ✅ USEFUL — companion to tweet #4**
Same source (Boris), different format. We already saved some Boris tips in `memory/claude-code-reference.md`.

**Action:** BACKLOG — Read the full article/thread and update our claude-code-reference.md with any new tips we're missing.

## 6. @_Auza_ — BankrBot Token Deployment on Base
**Link:** https://x.com/_Auza_/status/2020158205289222237
**Engagement:** 578 likes, 67 RT

**Summary:** Deploy meme tokens on Base via @bankrbot by tweeting. Earn from trading fees. Claims $300-$1.6K earned.

**Verdict: ⚠️ SCAMMY / HIGH RISK — SKIP**
Classic engagement farming for a token deployment bot. "Deploy tokens based on tweets" is essentially meme coin launching with extra steps. The "0.8 ETH profit" screenshots are classic shill tactics. Even if the platform is real, this is gambling disguised as a strategy. Reputational risk for @gabe_onchain (data analyst brand ≠ meme coin deployer).

**Action:** IGNORE. Does not align with our brand or goals.

## 7. @RoundtableSpace (0xMarioNawfal) — Agent Trading Terminal
**Link:** https://x.com/RoundtableSpace/status/2020131683522011580
**Engagement:** 462 likes, 40 RT

**Summary:** Trading terminal that turns your AI agent into a trader/analyst/market maker on SOL, BSC, and Base.

**Verdict: ⚠️ SPECULATIVE — low priority**
Mario Nawfal (known CT personality) promoting a trading terminal for agents. Could be interesting for the Polymarket bot idea eventually, but we have no funds allocated for trading and this is vague marketing without substance.

**Action:** BACKLOG (low priority) — File under "agent trading infrastructure" for when we actually build the Polymarket bot. Don't act on it now.

## 8. @EveyNFT — Phantom Hiring (25+ positions)
**Link:** https://x.com/EveyNFT/status/2020253972016271738
**Engagement:** 742 likes, 43 RT

**Summary:** Phantom wallet is hiring across engineering, product, design, marketing, growth. All remote. Includes "Senior Product Marketer - Remote-US" and "Lifecycle Marketing Lead - Remote-US."

**Verdict: ✅ VERY RELEVANT — JOB OPPORTUNITIES**
Phantom is a top-tier crypto company. Two marketing roles that could fit Gabe:
- **Senior Product Marketer** (Remote-US) — product marketing aligns with PM skills
- **Lifecycle Marketing Lead** (Remote-US) — email/growth marketing

Note: Both say "Remote-US" which could be US-only. Worth checking.

**Action:** ADD TO JOB APPLICATIONS — Check if "Remote-US" allows Brazil/Portugal timezone. Apply before Feb 14 round if eligible. Phantom is a great name on a resume.

## 9. @garrytan — Claude Code Plan Mode Prompt
**Link:** https://x.com/garrytan/status/2020072098635665909
**Engagement:** 3.6K likes, 186 RT — viral

**Summary:** Garry Tan (YC president) shares his Claude Code prompt for plan mode reviews. Covers: architecture review, code quality (DRY violations), test coverage, performance review. For each issue: describe concretely, present 2-3 options with tradeoffs, ask before assuming direction. Claims 4K+ LOC features in ~1 hour.

**Verdict: ✅ EXTREMELY USEFUL — save the full prompt**
This is gold. Garry Tan's engineering review prompt is structured, opinionated, and thorough. Aligns with our vibecoding best practices. The "ask before assuming direction" pattern prevents the lazy implementation problem we've hit.

**Action:** SAVE TO MEMORY — Add this prompt to our Claude Code reference. Use as template for all future code reviews and plan mode sessions.

## 10. YouTube — "How I Got 13,500 LinkedIn Followers Using AI"
**Link:** https://youtu.be/ePUJvMly1ig
**Summary:** AI-powered LinkedIn growth strategy. Couldn't extract full content (YouTube blocks scraping).

**Verdict: ⚠️ PROBABLY CLICKBAIT — low priority**
LinkedIn growth hacks aren't our priority. Gabe's strategy is X + portfolio, not LinkedIn. LinkedIn stays as-is for the SMM role.

**Action:** SKIP for now. If Gabe wants to explore LinkedIn growth later, revisit.

## Garry Tan's Full Prompt (saved for reference)

```
Review this plan thoroughly before making any code changes. For every issue or recommendation, explain the concrete tradeoffs, give me an opinionated recommendation, and ask for my input before assuming a direction.

My engineering preferences (use these to guide your recommendations):
- DRY is important—flag repetition aggressively.
- Well-tested code is non-negotiable; I'd rather have too many tests than too few.
- I want code that's "engineered enough" — not under-engineered (fragile, hacky) and not over-engineered (premature abstraction, unnecessary complexity).
- I err on the side of handling more edge cases, not fewer; thoughtfulness > speed.
- Bias toward explicit over clever.

1. Architecture review (system design, coupling, data flow, scaling, security)
2. Code quality review (organization, DRY violations, error handling, tech debt, over/under-engineering)
3. Test review (coverage gaps, assertion strength, edge cases, untested failure modes)
4. Performance review (N+1 queries, memory, caching, slow code paths)

For each issue: describe concretely with file/line refs, present 2-3 options including "do nothing", specify effort/risk/impact for each.
```
