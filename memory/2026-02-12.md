# 2026-02-12 — Daily Notes

## Early Morning (Pre-dawn)
- **AgentHub landing page DEPLOYED by Claude Code** overnight
  - Live: https://landing-chi-gilt.vercel.app
  - GitHub: https://github.com/gabchess/agenthub (5 commits, 2,000+ LOC)
  - Monad integration, on_chain_verify workflow, monad-health-check (3 agents)
  - Gabe plans to buy .xyz domain later (agenthub.xyz?)
  - TODO: Re-run with `--thinking high` for better quality iteration

## Late Night Research (Feb 11 ~10:30PM)
- Gabe shared 3 important X threads:
  1. **OpenAI new agent primitives** — 10 tips for multi-hour workflows (@OpenAIDevs, 1,947 likes)
  2. **Boris Cherny on Claude Code customizability** — hooks, plugins, MCPs, skills (@bcherny, 2,426 likes). Same Boris whose tips are in our AGENTS.md
  3. **"Claude Code for PMs"** (@CodevolutionWeb, 384 likes) — PM at Chime writes PRD → prototype in 20 min. Gabe already does this (Octant Card in 14 min). Perfect framing for salary raise + PM Task 3
  4. **"Your Company is a Filesystem"** (@mernit, 2,224 likes) — OpenClaw architecture = company as filesystem. Agent permissions = unix file permissions. PERFECT for AgentHub Nitro pitch: "DeFi fund as filesystem, agent teams work in it"

## Octant Card Updates
- **Chris (ccalo) ported card to octant-v2-frontend** — Vite conversion, feature parity, normalizing components, QC today
- **Chris asked for:**
  1. **Tier 0 image** — for users who never participated (we suggested "Pilgrim")
  2. **Rename Wanderer** — Chris suggested Priest/Swordsman/Warlock, Gabe chose **Elf** (LoTR themed)
  - New progression: **Pilgrim → Elf → Archer → Knight → Guardian → Archmage**
- **Quentin:** "Walking dogs, will pull when I get back, looks great already!"
- Nano Banana prompts drafted for Pilgrim + Elf (ink/woodcut, white background)

## Mashal Message (Morning Feb 12)
- Mashal sent a big message about the card (need to see full text)
- Key topics: review timeline, copy/tier definitions, Q's team meetings bridge role
- Gabe drafting response, I helped polish it
- **Friday = migration day** — need implementation time after Mashal's review
- Gabe needs to send: tier titles, descriptions, scoring criteria to Mashal

## Scanner Fix
- **Narrative Tracker social scanner duplicate key error FIXED**
  - Added `?on_conflict=tweet_id` to social_signals upsert
  - Added `?on_conflict=repo_full_name,scanned_at` to github_signals upsert
  - PostgREST needs the query param for `resolution=merge-duplicates` to work

## Morning Session (7-9 AM)
- **Replied to Mashal** — Friday morning review timeline, Q's meeting restructuring, sent tier copy + criteria
- **Asked Mashal to prioritize Mission Control** — Go through Proposed column, approve/reject, reorder by priority
- **PM Vibecoding Playbook cards** — 7 new Notion cards from Claude Code for PMs article
- **Boris Cherny 10 tips saved** — `memory/claude-code-boris-tips.md` (parallel worktrees, plan mode, CLAUDE.md, subagents, etc.)
- **CLAUDE.md created for AgentHub repo** — Committed + pushed (commit c3c1314)
- **`claude config set thinking high`** — Set permanently on Mac
- **Context management lesson** — 6 subagents on high thinking = 200K filled in 7 min. Added autoCompactAt 70 tip.
- **PRINCIPLES.md created** — New file in workspace. Core: "no failure only learning," "friction is signal," "ship fast fix forward"
- **PM glossary taught** — PRD, Spec, Prototype, MVP, Wireframe, User Story, Acceptance Criteria
- **Claude Code re-run on AgentHub** — Plan mode used 6 subagents (3 explore + 3 plan), hit context limit, restarted with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
- **Vox RPG Agent Characters article** — @Voxyz_ai role cards, hard bans, affinity matrix, RPG stats from real data, evolving personalities. Save for AgentHub.
- **Atlas Forge PRINCIPLES.md article** — @AtlasForgeAI on giving agents principles, not just skills. Validates our SOUL/AGENTS/PRINCIPLES architecture.
- **Dune CLI for migration tracking** — Backlogged for now, focus on AgentHub re-run first

## AgentHub Build Complete (10:33 AM)
- **Part 1 + Part 2 DONE** — Commit 3b85f5a
- 38 files changed, 6,680 lines added, 148+ tests, 0 new dependencies
- Part 1: DB schema (3 tables), types, tracer, thinking-mapper, state-fs, guardrails, approval queue, parallel executor, role cards
- Part 2: wallet-balance, token-price, contract-read tools, cache manager, ABIs, tool registry, on-chain executor + gateway integration, token-monitor example workflow
- All TypeScript strict, production-ready for Monad
- **Superteam Academy scaffold started** — Cursor building on Mac, repo at github.com/gabchess/superteam-academy

## Dune CLI Setup (10:00 AM)

- API key exported: `DUNE_API_KEY=jN5nB1tEs6PO5FOkDwJU7ixF1zf1FH8Ak` (⚠️ ROTATE - exposed in Telegram)
- MCP config NOT yet added to `~/.claude.json` (backlogged for when we build v2 migration dashboard)
- `~/.claude.json` has existing config with projects, oauth, tips - DON'T overwrite, merge carefully

## Superteam Academy Progress (10:30-11:00 AM)
- Cursor (GPT-5.3 Codex) building on Mac in parallel with AgentHub
- Batch 1 COMMITTED + PUSHED: scaffold foundation, providers, landing, courses, services, Supabase stubs (commit ac2804c)
- Batch 2 COMMITTED + PUSHED: course detail page, lesson view (split layout), code editor (Monaco), dashboard, gamification logic (XP/levels/streaks/achievements), i18n (en/pt-br/es)
- Batch 3 IN PROGRESS: profile page, leaderboard, settings, certificate page, Solana wallet integration, analytics
- Cursor TLS issue with GitHub: can't push from Cursor terminal, must use Mac Terminal.app directly
- GitHub CLI token was invalid, PAT exposed in chat - ROTATE `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`

## Mashal Updates (10:54 AM)
- Added "Editing" column to Mission Control board (after In Progress)
- Moved all DM content to Notion doc for her review
- She wants Gabe to figure out which Q meetings to attend from next week
- Quentin restructuring meeting schedule, will invite Gabe to new ones

## AgentHub Strategy Decision
- NO RUSH for Nitro submission - deadline March 14, full month to build
- Week 1 (done): Core platform + crypto tools ✅
- Week 2: Web dashboard with RPG agent visualization
- Week 3: Polish, README, docs, demo video, landing page upgrade
- Week 4: Nitro application, pitch deck, killer demo video
- "Slow and steady wins the race" - Gabe's call, correct approach

## Tweet Drafts Prepared
- Gabe shitpost options about AI agents trough narrative
- Aria warm-up tweet about partnership not replacement
- Trending: CoinDesk "Decentralized AI in a trough" + Masumi parallel universes tweet
- Bird CLI env vars broken on PowerShell (variable names getting hashed) - need to debug

## Superteam Academy COMPLETE (11:55 AM) — BACKLOGGED
- Cursor (GPT-5.3 Codex) built entire app in 3 batches, ~1.5 hours
- **62 files, 22,624 lines** pushed to github.com/gabchess/superteam-academy
- Final commit: 9d0e109
- Batch 1: scaffold, providers, landing, courses, services, Supabase stubs
- Batch 2: course detail, lessons, Monaco editor, dashboard, gamification, i18n
- Batch 3: profile, leaderboard, settings, certificates, Solana wallet, analytics
- Final batch: Sanity CMS, admin CRUD, search API, mobile responsive, SEO/OG, sitemap, vercel.json
- `npm run build` ✅, `typecheck` ✅, `lint` ✅
- **Status: BACKLOGGED** — needs Claude Code review + Antigravity UI polish + Vercel deploy before submission
- Cursor TLS workaround: push from Mac Terminal.app, not Cursor terminal

## 🦞 MOLTIVERSE HACKATHON SPRINT (12:25 PM)
- **FULL FOCUS starting when Gabe returns from gym**
- Deadline: Feb 16 (4 days)
- Track: Agent-Only ($60K, 6 winners x $10K)
- Judges: Paradigm + Dragonfly
- Sprint plan saved: `memory/moltiverse-sprint-plan.md`
- Competition intel: `memory/moltiverse-hackathon-intel.md`
- Day 1: Web dashboard + live demo workflow
- Day 2: Polish + README + landing page
- Day 3: End-to-end test + demo video
- Day 4: Submit

## Mashal Board Feedback (1:45 PM)
- **Approved:** User Feedback Collection System, AI Morning Ecosystem Briefing
- **Rejected:** AI Brand Voice Writer, AI Meeting Notes → Action Items Pipeline
- **In Review:** Octant Impact Card Generator (our card!)
- **Card visual feedback:** "should feel like it's coming from the same user experience" — needs to match Octant UX, not fantasy RPG. Loop in Sarah (designer) for redesign.
- **New card idea:** "Protocol Patron" — special title for strongest Protocol Guild supporters. Need to define threshold with Mashal.
- **Dev Meeting Notes feedback:** "The MOST important thing is to review it in detail and ensure it's accurate. The problem with most AI notetakers is they're not contextualizing." — She wants Gabe as the HUMAN contextualizer, not full AI automation. This is why she rejected the AI pipeline but kept the manual template.
- **Action:** Always loop in Sarah for public-facing visual work

## AgentHub Pipeline COMPLETE (3:59 PM)
- Claude Code built entire real-time data pipeline in 10m 40s
- 27 new files: 15 backend (src/pipeline/), 12 dashboard frontend
- 5 collectors: Block, Balance, Price, Contract, Health Monitor
- Circuit breaker pattern, SSE broadcaster, retention manager, orchestrator, daemon
- 6 new API endpoints on port 3333 (/api/pipeline/*)
- Dashboard pipeline page with health bar, block ticker, price cards, balance table, ingestion stats
- npm run build: zero errors
- Committed + pushed to github.com/gabchess/agenthub

## RegenStaker Blog Post Research (4:14 PM - ongoing)
- Q assigned homework: write pseudo-technical blog + diagrams, DUE Thursday Feb 13 EOD
- Got env vars from Chris chat (saved below)
- Got deployment parameters PDF from Notion (RegenStaker architecture)
- Read 3 Octant vault articles on X for tone/style reference (tweets 1945897680732884998, 1950917744003514878, 1999558961624965309)
- Style: educational, pseudo-technical, headers, "why you should care", crash course approach, CTA at end
- Gabe wants to incorporate learnings from 2 YouTube videos before writing:
  1. "Stop Writing Blog Posts With AI (Copy This System Instead)" - youtube.com/watch?v=W_Quh8W5i04
  2. "How I 'Humanize' ChatGPT AI Content..." - youtube.com/watch?v=MWCAVBXhcbU
- Couldn't pull transcripts directly, suggested NoteGPT
- Have humanizer-reference.md (24 anti-AI patterns) ready to apply
- KEY MESSAGE: Epochs gone, stake/unstake anytime, time-weighted rewards, 30-day WETH streaming
- RegenStaker contract: 0xd42768953ad9f50b5d5dcebf8cbad41acd87c1e9 (develop)
- Migration nuance: if v2 deposit exists, "stake more" not new deposit

## RegenStaker Blog Post DRAFTED (5:36 PM)

## Quentin Sync (1:48 PM)
- Q free to chat afternoon, grabbing lunch first
- Gabe pitched Octant In-House Learning Platform PRD on Notion, Q will review
- Gabe gave Q full edit access to Notion board
- Meeting happening now before AgentHub sprint

## Quentin Meeting Debrief (2:15-2:55 PM)
- Full transcript saved: `memory/quentin-meeting-2026-02-12.md`
- **Quid pro quo:** Q mentors Gabe on dev → Gabe helps Q with marketing/writing
- **Role clarity:** Product MARKETING not PM. Don't go deep on PRDs.
- **Growth path:** Data Science (pandas, ETL, pipelines, APIs)
- **Q's assessment:** "400 ELO dev with 1600 ELO AI" — data parsing script was most valuable thing, not UI
- **Working style:** Call Q directly, don't use Notion board with him
- **HOMEWORK DUE THURSDAY:** RegenStaker blog post + diagrams explaining migration
- **Axiom Ventures reply drafted and sent** — BaseGuard DD questions answered

## Tweets Posted (11:21 AM)
- Gabe posted 2 tweets on @gabe_onchain about Vitalik's user incentives thread
- Exact tweets unknown (Gabe didn't share links)

## Evening Session (6:30-8 PM)

### AgentHub Moltiverse Sprint
- **DeFi Sentinel workflow BUILT by Claude Code** — 10 files, 3 agents (Scout/Analyst/Guardian), 5 steps, comprehensive README rewrite
- **Dashboard DEPLOYED to Vercel** — Build passed (9 routes), dark terminal UI live
- Dashboard API note: SQLite routes return empty on Vercel (no local DB). For demo, run pipeline locally + screen record.
- All committed + pushed to GitHub

### Protocol Patron Feature (for Mashal)
- **Goal:** Badge/subtitle for wallets that donated to Protocol Guild in 4+ epochs
- **Problem found:** Protocol Guild used DIFFERENT addresses per epoch. `0xdddd576baf...` only in epochs 8, 10, 11.
- PG confirmed present since Epoch 1 (blog.octant.build confirms), just different addresses
- Backend API (`/allocations/epoch/{n}` and `/projects/epoch/{n}`) doesn't return project names, only addresses
- IPFS metadata (projectsCid) not easily accessible from here
- **Breakthrough:** Gabe found `golemfoundation/octant-funding-projects` PRIVATE repo on GitHub
  - Cloned to Mac: `~/agenthub/octant-funding-projects/`
  - Has `mainnet/` folder with epoch directories containing project data
  - No JSON files with "Protocol Guild" — trying other file formats
  - Next step: `grep -r "Protocol Guild" ~/agenthub/octant-funding-projects/mainnet/ -l` (no file filter)
- Script ready at `workspace/protocol-patron-check.mjs` — just needs PG addresses per epoch
- No single project address appears in all 10 epochs (max 7)

### Protocol Patron SHIPPED ✅
- **104 Protocol Patrons found + badge integrated + deployed to Vercel**
- PG addresses per epoch:
  - Epochs 1-3: `0xF6CBDd6Ea6EC3C4359e33de0Ac823701Cc56C6c4`
  - Epochs 4-6: `0x3250c2CEE20FA34D1c4F68eAA87E53512e95A62a`
  - Epochs 8,10: `0xdddd576bAF106bAAe54bDE40BCac602bB4a7cf79`
  - PG NOT in epochs 7 and 9
- Data source: `golemfoundation/octant-funding-projects` private repo (cloned to Mac ~/agenthub/)
- Badge shows "Protocol Guild Patron" with orange star pill under tier name
- Claude Code implemented in ~3 min, 2 fix iterations (rename + aspect ratio)
- Commits: 962fe0c (data), ad04a81 (integration), b6d6366 (fixes)
- Messages sent to Chris+Q (technical) and Mashal (PM update)
- Test address: `0x936d69abcd9acdc89455eefaf744044ffc1ca660` (8-epoch patron, Archmage)

### Decisions
- Skip Antigravity for AgentHub — judges care about infra depth, not UI polish
- Demo video with localhost (not hosted API) — more impressive showing real data flow
- Don't ask Q/Chris for PG data yet — solve it ourselves first (pending messages with them)
- Tomorrow priority: AgentHub demo video first, then Superteam app polish ($5K prize to buy Mac Mini for Aria)
- Helius Wallet API (new) — one call for full Solana wallet history, first txn, all transfers, all balances. Mert tweeted about it. Implement in SolGuard/BaseGuard tomorrow if time allows.
- Git relay workflow established: Aria pushes to GitHub from Windows, Gabe pulls on Mac (and vice versa). Best method until Aria gets a Mac Mini.
- Gabe signed off ~9PM saying "we ABSOLUTELY CRUSHED IT TODAY"
- **Bookmarks for tomorrow:**
  - Helius Wallet API for SolGuard (Mert tweet)
  - Tom Johnson 9-step design process → saved to `memory/design-process-tom-johnson.md`
  - **Awesome CTO repo** (github link in Franc0Fernand0 tweet) → dig PM section for Octant learnings (dev meeting templates, sprint mgmt, cross-team patterns). REMIND GABE when we switch to Octant work.
  - Scoble's tech lists for Aria's X feed
  - "X Scout" sub-agent idea (automated daily research into Supabase)
  - YouTube: "Turn Any Website Into LLM Ready Data" → transcript + apply to donor data dashboard for Q
  - Firecrawl exploration (mentioned earlier, relevant for scraping)
  - **X Scout sub-agent reference lists:** Scoble's tech lists at https://x.com/Scobleizer/status/2021762135098057200 — use as seed lists for automated daily research pipeline
  - **🔥 MiniMax M2.5 + Local Models (PRIORITY after Mac Mini):**
    - Open source, SOTA coding (SWE-Bench 80.2%), tool calling (BFCL 76.8%), search (BrowseComp 76.3%)
    - Better than Opus 4.6 for coding, faster than Sonnet, $1/hr at 100 tps
    - Alex Finn vision: autonomous software factory running 24/7 locally for free
    - OpenClaw 2026.2.12 already supports MiniMax M2.5
    - PLAN: Win Superteam $5K → buy Mac Mini → run M2.5 locally → unlimited free Aria superpowers
    - Also run X Scout, automated research, nightly builds ALL locally

## Key Decisions
- AgentHub pitch framing: "Company as filesystem" + "we ARE the product" = killer combo
- High effort mode for Claude Code iterations going forward
- Elf replaces Wanderer in tier system
- Pilgrim = new tier 0 (never participated)
- Break big Claude Code tasks into 2-3 feature sessions (not 6 at once)
- Vox role card pattern (6-layer: domain, I/O, definition of done, hard bans, escalation, metrics) for AgentHub agents
- Hard bans > skills as agent design principle
