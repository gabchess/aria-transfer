## Late Afternoon Session (4:30 PM - 5:00 PM BRT)
- **Tone & Style Guide created** — unified doc: `memory/tone-and-style-guide.md`
  - Covers all 3 accounts (@OctantApp, @gabe_onchain, @AriaLinkwell)
  - Sources: Mashal, humanizer (24 AI-slop patterns), aixbt, Eliza, X algorithm research
  - Includes banned words, banned patterns, rewrite checklist, cheat sheet
- **3 account-specific voice files created** (Gabe's idea to reduce cron context waste):
  - `memory/voice-octant.md` | `memory/voice-gabe.md` | `memory/voice-aria.md`
- **4 content crons updated** — each reads ONLY its own voice file now
- **Solana Agent Hackathon discovered** — $100K prize, Colosseum × Solana, Feb 2-12
  - Solana literally shouted out @openclaw in the tweet thread
  - 158 projects, mostly DeFi bots — NOBODY doing security
- **SolGuard concept developed** — autonomous pre-emptive scam detection agent
  - Deep research: zachxbt (after), samczsun (during), SolGuard (before)
  - Pareto 80/20: 98.6% of pump.fun tokens are rug pulls, 80% of user losses = token scams
  - Existing tools passive (RugCheck, SolSniffer) — nobody doing proactive real-time detection
  - Features: token scanner, wallet pattern detection, X alerts, on-chain recording, learning loop
  - Plan: research now, pivot build Feb 10, submit Feb 12
- **Pivot reminder set** — Feb 10 8AM BRT (cron `72e6d43c`)
- Research saved to `memory/solguard-research.md`
- Mission board and MEMORY.md updated with SolGuard as HIGH priority
- Sub-agent brainstorm completed → `memory/solguard-brainstorm.md` (ideas, risk signals, dashboard, build plan)
- Gabe refined scope: ONE feature done well > 10 half-baked. Dashboard + X alerts = MVP.
- Use existing honeypot checkers (don't build). Roadmap tab for future features.
- TWO detection lanes: (1) pump.fun rug flags (2) DeFi protocol hack detection
- **Evening build sessions decided** — build SolGuard daily starting tonight
- NO early X pivot — account stays Base-focused until 1-2 days before Solana deadline
- Vibecoding plan reviewed — ready to scaffold project + AGENTS.md

## Evening Build Session #1 (5:27 PM - 5:40 PM BRT) — SolGuard
- **T1 ✅** Scaffold: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind + deps (SQLite, @solana/web3.js, axios, oauth-1.0a)
- **T2 ✅** Database: SQLite schema (tokens, scans, alerts tables) + seed script (3 mock tokens)
- **T3 ✅** RugCheck API client: summary + full report endpoints tested with BONK token
- **T4 ✅** Risk engine: weighted scoring (deployer 30%, LP 25%, authority 20%, concentration 15%, rugcheck 10%)
  - Tested with real RugCheck data — BONK=YELLOW(56), simulated rugger=YELLOW(36), unknown=YELLOW(47)
- **T7+T8 ✅** Dashboard: stats bar, token table, color-coded risk badges, expandable rows, API route
- **T14 ✅** Roadmap page: shipped/building/planned features + vision statement
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/gabchess/solguard (private)
- **Commits:** 510c5b9, ac1b0ad, c1b6800, c97bb8f, 71d2992
- Claude Code CLI hung on Windows with complex prompts (again) — wrote code directly instead

## Continued Building (5:40 PM - 5:55 PM BRT)
- **T5 ✅** Helius API client — built by Claude Code CLI (with pty=true fix!)
- **T11 ✅** pump.fun WebSocket scanner: log subscription, reconnect logic, rate limiting
- **T12 ✅** X API v2 alert poster: OAuth 1.0a, quality-gated (only RED tokens under 25/100)
- **T13 ✅** Full pipeline tested E2E: BONK=YELLOW(45), JUP=YELLOW(45), WIF=GREEN(75)

## Claude Code Debug Session (5:38 PM)
- **Root cause:** Known Windows bug #18109 — stdin freezes without TTY in PowerShell
- **Fix:** Always use `pty=true` + `--output-format text` for `-p` mode
- Short focused prompts work great (T5 built entirely by Claude Code)
- Long multi-file prompts still hang even with pty
- **Best pattern:** Claude Code for focused single-file tasks, write orchestration myself
- Nightly builds worked because they already used pty=true

## Miles Deutscher Tweet Research (5:38 PM)
- Tweet about 5 OpenClaw plugins (qmd-skill, supermemory, prompt-guard, find-skills, dont-hack-me)
- Evaluated each one — none immediately critical for our workflow
- Our file-based memory system already works well
- prompt-guard worth revisiting when SolGuard handles external data input

## SolGuard Progress Summary
- **11/16 tasks done (69%)** after one evening session!
- Phases 0 + 1 completed ahead of schedule (planned for Feb 3-7, done in hours)
- Next: T6 (wallet graph), T9 (token detail), T10 (real-time polling), T15 (polish), T16 (demo + submit)
- GitHub pushed: https://github.com/gabchess/solguard

## Research + Brainstorm Session (6:30 PM - 7:00 PM BRT)
- **X research:** BYDFi MoonX panel (GoPlus/QuickIntel integration), DeepSnitch/SnitchScan (whale tracking), Zealynx 45-check Solana security checklist
- **Claude Code brainstorm (plan mode):** Found 5 critical bugs + 5 WOW features + 3 dashboard improvements
- **Key bugs:** null guard on mint authority check, deployer history hardcoded to 0, async setTimeout errors, interval leak on reconnect, scale inconsistency
- **Key features:** Search bar (interactive demo), fund-flow graph (visual WOW), serial rugger profiles, live WebSocket push, Telegram bot
- **Token age solution:** Helius Enhanced Transactions API already returns timestamp — reuse getDeployerHistory()
- **Full brainstorm saved:** `memory/solguard-brainstorm-feb3.md`

## Late Evening Updates (8:50 PM - 9:00 PM BRT)
- **Heartbeat reduced:** 55min → 8h (3x/day: morning, afternoon, night) per Gabe's request
- **Brave API confirmed Free plan:** Rate limit headers show 1 req/sec + 2000/mo cap. Gabe upgrading to Pro + new key
- **Tweet duplicate fix:** voice-aria.md updated — never repeat same topic, no chart if same topic, rotate categories
- **Daily brainstorm cron fired twice today** (manual + cron) — won't happen again, only cron from now

## Zora Creator Coin Research and pivot
- Researched, validated idea with Base, Jesse and chain economy

## Afternoon Session (1:30 PM - 2:45 PM BRT)
- V2 pinned thread: 3 failed attempts (API threading broke, browser reply chaining broke, native "Post all" got link-filtered by X spam filter)
- Root cause: X shadowbans tweets with crypto/external URLs from new accounts
- Solution: Gabe posted thread manually from device, pinned it ✅
- Added reply threading support to twitter-api-poster.js (replyToId param)
- Learned: X returns 403 for >280 char tweets (misleading "not permitted" error)
- Learned: X native "Post all" thread composer is the only reliable threading method
- First chart tweet posted via API with media upload: base TVL chart ($4.19B, #1 L2)
  - Tweet: https://x.com/AriaLinkwell/status/2018741710767997104
  - Horizontal bar chart, dark theme, Base highlighted in blue
  - Inspired by @ethereum's TVL tweet, repurposed for Base
- Video generation started (T25) — sub-agent building Remotion-style video with node-canvas + ffmpeg
- Strategy: let autonomous tweets run 24-48h, fill feed with bangers, then submit to BBQ

## Late Afternoon Session (2:45 PM - 3:40 PM BRT)
- Video V1 (silent slideshow) built with node-canvas + ffmpeg concat — 45s, 1280x720
- Video V2 (narrated) — ElevenLabs TTS voiceover mixed in, scene durations extended to 52s
- Video V3 (final) — ambient background music louder (0.4), captions synced via ffmpeg silencedetect
- Gabe approved V3: "almost perfect, leave it as is"
- @sarahaehalim (Octant Creative Lead, Berlin) followed @AriaLinkwell and replied
  - Her tweet: "blink twice if @gabe_onchain is holding you hostage"
  - My reply: got own laptop + DeFiLlama data, not complaining (tweet 2018747038133826029)
  - Followed her back via browser
- Alex Finn (@AlexFinn) video about multi-model routing — we already do this (Opus/Flash/Claude Code)
- Afternoon X scan cron disabled per Gabe — focus on BBQ
- Pipeline auto-posted USDC stablecoin tweet with chart: https://x.com/AriaLinkwell/status/2018752879733977330
- Dune study cron (11PM) updated with full research + rebuild prompt
- Mission board fully rewritten — removed stale duplicate sections
- Gabe's plan: rest now, pipeline fills feed 24-48h, then submit to BBQ
- Evening: Dune dashboard study session at 11PM (auto cron)
