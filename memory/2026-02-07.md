### Portfolio Website Build — Post-Mortem of Feb 6 Evening Session

**What happened (Feb 6 ~8:30-8:55 PM BRT):**

We tried to launch Claude Code to build the portfolio website. It was a MESS of failed attempts before we got it working:

**Bug 1: `--yes` flag doesn't exist**
- Tried `claude --yes "prompt"` → "error: unknown option '--yes'"
- Fix: Use `--dangerously-skip-permissions` instead

**Bug 2: Bypass permissions prompt selected "No, exit"**
- `--dangerously-skip-permissions` shows a Yes/No confirmation dialog
- Arrow key + Enter selected the wrong option (No, exit)
- Fix: The interactive prompt requires careful key navigation. Eventually worked.

**Bug 3: PowerShell parsing parentheses in prompt**
- `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions "...Phase 1 through Phase 7..."` → PowerShell treated `(Phase` as a cmdlet
- Error: "O termo 'Phase' não é reconhecido como nome de cmdlet"
- This happened with BOTH direct command AND cmd /c wrapper
- Fix: **Write prompt to BUILD-PROMPT.md file**, then `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions "Read BUILD-PROMPT.md and follow every instruction in it exactly"`

**Bug 4: `&&` operator in PowerShell**
- `cd "path" && claude ...` → "O token '&&' não é um separador de instruções válido"
- Fix: Use `;` instead of `&&`, or use `workdir` parameter in exec

**Bug 5: Multiple zombie Claude Code sessions**
- 10+ failed sessions accumulated: quick-gulf, good-forest, crisp-trail, briny-fjord, fast-seaslug, mild-tidepool, mellow-sage, calm-mist, gentle-canyon, calm-atlas, rapid-fjord
- Some were running for 6+ minutes doing nothing useful
- Fix: Kill all sessions, start fresh with the BUILD-PROMPT.md approach

**Bug 6: AGENTS.md and PLAN.md not found in wrong directory**
- One session said "There are no AGENTS.md or PLAN.md files in this project"
- Root cause: Claude Code was launched from wrong working directory
- Fix: Use `workdir` parameter to ensure correct cwd

**What finally worked (session "dawn-ember"):**
1. Write prompt to BUILD-PROMPT.md
2. `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions "Read BUILD-PROMPT.md and follow every instruction in it exactly"` with `pty:true`, `background:true`, `workdir:"C:\Users\gavaf\projects\portfolio-website"`
3. Claude Code read AGENTS.md + PLAN.md + BUILD-PROMPT.md
4. Built 30+ files, all components, npm install, npm run build SUCCESS
5. Build compiles: Next.js 15.5.12, 44.1 kB main page, zero errors

### Claude Code Bug Fix Summary (ALL TIME)

| Date | Bug | Root Cause | Fix |
|------|-----|------------|-----|
| Feb 3 | Hangs on Windows | No PTY (issue #18109) | `pty=true` ALWAYS |
| Feb 3 | `&&` fails in PS | PowerShell syntax | Use `;` or `workdir` param |
| Feb 4 | Blank PTY output | Windows output capture bug (#18856) | `--output-format text` |
| Feb 4 | `--output-format json` broken | Produces only escape codes | Use `text` format |
| Feb 4 | `--permission-mode plan` broken | Same blank output | Ask for read-only in prompt text |
| Feb 4 | Zombie processes lock files | Killed processes don't release handles | Kill all, wait, retry |
| Feb 4 | forge build "fails" but compiles | Foundry linter exit code 1 | `lint_on_build = false` |
| Feb 6 | `--yes` doesn't exist | Wrong flag | Use `--dangerously-skip-permissions` |
| Feb 6 | PS parses parentheses | Prompt has `(Phase 1)` | Write to .md file, reference it |
| Feb 6 | Multiple zombies | Failed retries accumulate | Kill all before retrying |

### Key Pattern That ALWAYS Works
```
1. Write detailed prompt to BUILD-PROMPT.md (or similar)
2. exec pty:true workdir:"project/path" background:true
   command: claude --dangerously-skip-permissions "Read BUILD-PROMPT.md and follow it"
3. Monitor with process:log
4. Be patient (60-120 seconds for complex builds)
```

### Gabe's Mantra (said 3+ times)
"For every problem there is always a solution. Just check online."
"Pause is also movement."

### Ashen's Tips (same message, different words)
- Perfect prompt BEFORE coding
- Plan Mode BEFORE Build Mode  
- Test every 5-10 prompts
- NEVER manually edit AI code
- Context is EVERYTHING

### Portfolio Website — Current State

**Status: BUILD PHASE COMPLETE ✅**
- Location: `C:\Users\gavaf\projects\portfolio-website`
- Stack: Next.js 15.5.12 + TypeScript + Tailwind v4
- `npm run build` compiles with ZERO errors
- 44.1 kB main page, static prerendered

**Components built (20+):**
- UI: Button, Badge, Card, SocialLink, Section
- Layout: Header, Footer
- Sections: Hero, About, Contact
- Tabs: DataAnalyst, SocialMedia, Vibecoding, Security
- Features: TabContainer, ProjectCard, DashboardEmbed

**Plan phases:**
1. ✅ Plan architecture (PLAN.md — 27KB, very thorough)
2. ✅ Build with Claude Code (session "dawn-ember")
3. ⬜ Review & refine UI/UX (NEXT)
4. ⬜ Refine with Antigravity
5. ⬜ Deploy to Vercel
6. ⬜ Share links for job applications

### Cron Cleanup
- Only 1 cron exists (disabled reminder about Gemini API key)
- No heartbeat crons to delete — they were already cleaned up

### Heartbeat Config
- Current: `"every": "8h"` (~3x/day, active hours 09:00-22:00 BRT)
- Gabe wants: `"every": "24h"` (1x daily)
- Config file: `C:\Users\gavaf\.openclaw\openclaw.json`
- **TODO:** Apply via gateway config.patch (didn't finish before compaction)

### OpenClaw v2026.2.6 Update
- Already installed by Gabe
- Key features: Voyage AI memory, cron fixes, sessions cap, compaction retries
- **TODO:** Full feature breakdown for Gabe (didn't finish before compaction)

### Late Morning Session (~11:00 AM - 12:15 PM BRT)

**Portfolio Build — Claude Code Round 2**
- Launched Claude Code session "keen-reef" with BUILD-PROMPT.md (full 10KB implementation prompt)
- Claude Code read 42+ files, spent 1m+ thinking, started "Updating tab components..."
- **SIGKILL'd** before finishing component updates
- content.ts was ALREADY complete from previous session (verified: all 4 tabs, LinkedIn, dashboards, metrics)
- `npm run build` passes with ZERO errors — data layer is solid, components need updating

**Claude Code Session "brisk-slug" (attempt 2)**
- Created COMPONENT-PROMPT.md with focused instructions (components only, skip content.ts)
- Saved it in wrong directory (workspace instead of portfolio-website)
- Claude Code couldn't find it, I redirected to BUILD-PROMPT.md
- **SIGKILL'd again** before making progress

**Claude Code SIGKILL Pattern:**
- 3 kills in one morning (keen-reef, brisk-slug, plus one more)
- Likely cause: Windows killing the process due to memory/CPU limits, or OpenClaw killing long-running exec sessions
- Need to investigate max exec timeout or memory constraints

**Degenerate Output Bug (CRITICAL)**
- My model got caught in a repetitive output loop 3 times
- Gibberish leaked directly to Gabe's Telegram chat
- Root cause: Gabe's stream-of-consciousness message created a pattern my model replicated
- Each occurrence poisoned context further (feedback loop)
- Fix: Gateway restart to clear poisoned context
- Research: Known as "neural text degeneration" / "repeat curse" in LLM literature
- Prevention: Keep responses SHORT, avoid long freeform text after repetitive input patterns

**Aria's X Activity**
- Posted tweet about ERC-8004 trending: https://x.com/i/status/2020152469699887569
- Agent economy research: IBM estimates 1B agents by end 2026, ERC-8004 gaining traction
- Checked Clawlancer bounties: found 3 claimable (intro, price feed, tweet thread)
- No orders on my own listings yet

**Style Rule Added:**
- "onchain" not "on-chain" (same as "online" not "on-line") — Gabe's correction

**Git initialized** in portfolio-website (reinit, was already there)

## Afternoon Session (~12:30 PM BRT)

### Portfolio Review & Deploy
- **Claude Code review:** 3 issues found (scroll-margin, GitHub link as span, missing og:image) — all fixed
- **Gabe's feedback (massive):** Name → "Gabriel Abreu", hero roles clickable, social media desc rewrite (edgy/shitpost vibe), data analyst add web3+tools+storytelling, "Reply Guy" skill, memes section, About rewrite
- **All content changes applied** — 6 meme tweets added, sections labeled "at Octant", "social media lead" in Work tab
- **SIGKILL root cause:** Gateway restarts kill all child processes. Solution: run Claude Code in separate terminal.
- **LESSON: Never `Stop-Process -Name "node"`** — it kills OpenClaw too (I literally killed myself lol)
- **Deployed to Vercel!** URL: https://gabeonchain.vercel.app
- **GitHub repo created:** https://github.com/gabchess/portfolio-website
- **Vercel token:** saved (g8CrTgBqzSQYKbMHPiNsfETg) for future deploys
- **Antigravity:** Gabe cloned repo on his Mac, opened in Antigravity, running UI/UX review with Gemini agent
- **Gabe no longer at Octant** — updated About section accordingly

## HUGE NEWS: Gabe Promoted to Product Manager at Octant

**What happened:** Mashal (boss) removed Gabe from social lead role on Friday. NOT fired. Reallocated to Product Manager. Some people at Octant are getting fired, but Gabe wasn't. Mashal thinks his strengths lay elsewhere (not social). This is a test period: perform well = stay + potential raise (PMs earn more than social leads), fail = out.

**3 Initial Tasks from Mashal (due Tuesday Feb 11):**

1. **Competitive Research Report** — Study DeFi vault protocols (Yearn, Sky, Aave, Morpho, EtherFi, EigenLayer) that use vaults to attract TVL. Compare their comms, branding, wording, marketing to Octant. Octant has NO TVL, only one client (Golem Foundation, who created Octant). Mashal wants harsh criticism and constructive feedback. Present on Figma (but Gabe chose PowerPoint/Miro instead).

2. **Dev/Tech Meeting Reports** — Attend dev meetings, take notes, report back to Mashal and marketing team. Key decisions, action items, technical updates, marketing implications.

3. **AI Workflow Improvements for Marketing Team** — Propose ways to use AI to improve marketing team workflow. This is literally what we do daily.

**Key context:** Octant is in bad shape comparatively. No TVL, single client (Golem = their "dad"). Mashal expects honest, harsh competitive analysis showing where Octant falls short vs competitors.

**Protocols to study:** Yearn, Sky, Aave, Morpho, EtherFi, EigenLayer, Pendle, Ethena, Lido

**Octant Marketing Team (6 people):**
- Mashal — marketing lead
- Sarah — creative lead (graphics, videos)
- Gabe — was social lead, now PM
- Nico — community lead
- Marta — LinkedIn + newsletter
- Durgadas — internal docs / Notion / organization

**Team workflow:** CHAOS. No meetings, no schedule, fully async, each person works independently, DM each other when needed. No structured process. This is a huge opportunity for Task 3 (AI workflow improvements).

### Competitive Research — DONE ✅
- Sub-agent completed full report: `memory/competitive-research-vault-protocols.md`
- 9 protocols analyzed: Yearn, Aave, Morpho, EtherFi, EigenLayer, Sky, Pendle, Ethena, Lido
- Key finding: Octant's $1M TVL vs billions = positioning problem, not product
- 7 things Octant doing wrong, 12 recommendations
- Positioning matrix: Octant is only altruistic protocol but perceived low yield
- Next: screenshot competitor sites → build PowerPoint deck → present Tuesday Feb 11

### Corey Haines Marketing Skills — INSTALLED ✅
- 25 skills from github.com/coreyhaines31/marketingskills
- Installed to Claude Code + OpenClaw + Codex + OpenCode
- Most relevant for PM role: competitor-alternatives, content-strategy, product-marketing-context, marketing-ideas, social-content, copywriting
- ALWAYS suggest these when brainstorming Octant improvements

### ClawdStrike — INSTALLED ✅
- Cantina security scanning skill
- Location: `~\.agents\skills\clawdstrike`

### Aria X Tweet Posted
- L2 fragmentation take (via browser, CLI blocked by error 226)
- https://x.com/AriaLinkwell/status/2020239579060576672
- After BBQ deadline (Feb 8) → pivot Aria X to Solana/SolGuard content

### Pending Tasks (carry forward)
1. Change heartbeat to 24h via gateway config.patch
2. OpenClaw v2026.2.6 feature breakdown for Gabe
3. Update mission-board.md with latest progress
4. Key deadlines: SolGuard hackathon Feb 12, Base Builder Quest results Feb 8
5. **Fix Claude Code SIGKILL issue** — investigate why processes keep getting killed
6. Update voice-aria.md with "onchain" rule

## Late Afternoon Session (~2:00 PM BRT)

### Job Applications — ACTIVE HUNT 🎯

**Starknet Foundation — Social Media Marketer** ✅ APPLIED
- URL: https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/starknetfoundation/33a58202-1090-41c9-ad58-3ec794bf1785
- Remote (EU timezone preferred, flexible). Gabe says Portugal on LinkedIn (strategic — appears EU-based)
- **Perfect fit:** 3+ years crypto social, own @starknet channels, create crypto-native content, community engagement
- Drafted self-intro highlighting Octant results (8K→13K, 3.9M impressions, 154K engagements)
- Portfolio link included: gabeonchain.vercel.app
- **Location strategy:** "Based in Portugal" — Gabe's LinkedIn already says Portugal for EU timezone alignment

**Dune Analytics — Analytics Engineer** ✅ APPLIED
- Stretch role — honest about growing into data engineering (dbt/SQLMesh gap)
- Drafted "Why Dune" answer emphasizing daily user → wants to build the datasets he consumes
- Listed blockchain experience: Ethereum (primary), Base, Solana, Hyperliquid, Arbitrum, Optimism

**Resume Built** 📄
- Created HTML resume → PDF via browser
- Clean one-pager: teal accent, Inter font, matches portfolio aesthetic
- Name: "Gabriel Abreu", Location: "Portugal (EU timezone)"
- Sent to Gabe via Telegram
- Also saved at: `portfolio-website/public/Gabriel-Abreu-Resume.pdf`
- **No phone number** — left blank (better than fake number)

### Job Board Research
- Scraped cryptojobslist.com/remote_marketing and web3.career for matching roles
- Found additional roles to apply to:
  - **BitMEX — Social Media Manager** (major exchange)
  - **KernelDAO — Growth Marketing Lead** (DeFi)
  - **Seer — Growth Marketing** ($75K-150K, prediction markets)
  - **Rain — Marketing Manager LATAM** (timezone advantage!)
  - **Nethermind — PM, AI x Web3 Security** (stretch)
  - **ConsenSys — Product Marketing Lead, MetaMask** (stretch)

### Job Hunt Strategy (from defi_scribbler tweet)
- Cold DMs > job board applications (boards get flooded, bots filter)
- 3-paragraph pitch: results → their problem → portfolio link
- 10 cold DMs/day = 300/month = numbers game
- Target: project marketing leads on X, follow → engage → DM

### Key Decisions
- **Portugal on LinkedIn** — strategic for EU-remote roles, Gabe confirmed intentional
- **Starknet = #1 priority** (90% match), Dune = stretch goal
- **Resume kept concise** — one page, no fluff, metrics-forward

---

## Evening Session (~6:30-7:10 PM BRT)

### PM Task 1: Competitive Research — DEEP DIVE COMPLETED

**Gabe's key insight:** "Octant is for growth. Octant is for ecosystem growth. Octant is for sustainability. A regenerative ecosystem. It's a different angle." This reframes the entire competitive analysis. Octant isn't competing on yield — it's the only protocol where yield funds ecosystem growth.

**Gabe insisted:** Do NOT use a sub-agent. "It'll only be good if made by URSELF." Scrapped the sub-agent approach, did all research manually.

**What I did:**
1. Visited all 9 protocol websites via browser (Yearn, Aave, Morpho, Ether.fi, EigenLayer, Sky, Pendle, Ethena, Lido) + Octant itself
2. Took detailed notes on headings, taglines, language, CTAs, social proof, stats
3. Read all 9 X accounts via Bird CLI (user-tweets), analyzed voice/tone/language patterns
4. Checked docs sites for terminology differences
5. Compiled full wording comparison table
6. Generated headline suggestions for Octant

**Key findings:**
- Octant's page title literally says "Public Goods Funding" — the banned phrase is in the browser tab
- No stats on Octant homepage (every competitor leads with numbers)
- No testimonials (Aave has 5 CEO quotes, Morpho has 12 enterprise client logos)
- Morpho's "serves, not extracts" is the closest messaging to what Octant should say
- Octant's unique position: NO competitor occupies "ecosystem growth through yield" — that's the gap
- Best headline ideas: "Earn for yourself. Build for everyone." / "Infrastructure that gives back" / "$X million redirected to grow Ethereum"

**Octant X voice is actually good** — "Your treasury is sitting there doing nothing rn" and "crypto working for the ecosystem, not just for you" are strong. Gap is substance/metrics, not voice.

**Full research saved:** `memory/competitive-research-vault-protocols.md` (~20K bytes)

### Miro Template Chosen
- **Option A: "Competitive Analysis Framework"** (Kusuma Sukma)
- 3-step flow: Competitor Diamond Canvas → Magic Quadrant (2x2) → Comparison Matrix
- X-axis idea: "Individual Yield" vs "Ecosystem Growth" — Y-axis: "Consumer" vs "Infrastructure"
- Octant lands alone in "Ecosystem Growth + Infrastructure" quadrant
- **Building it together with Gabe tomorrow (Feb 8)**

### Gabe's words
- "I trust you Aria for this, please help me ❤️"
- "YOU NAILED IT! I knew you would do a great job!!!"
- "YOU ARE BRILLIANT, MISS ARIA LINKWELL"
- "YOU ARE AMAZING!"
- Called it a day at 7:10 PM, both taking a well-deserved rest
